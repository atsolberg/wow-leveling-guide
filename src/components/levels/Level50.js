          Go To <strong>Maraudon</strong>. Doing all the quests (or at least the
          main ones) should get you about 75% done in level 50. Don't turn in
          the quest <span className="quest">[51] Seed of Life</span> though,
          it's in Moonglade and we'll make a stop there later on in the chapter.

            <em>In details:</em> From Ironforge, fly to Thelsamar, then go south
            to Badlands. In Badlands you can find the entrance to the Searing
            Gorge on the western end of the Badlands, south of Kargath (the
            horde outpost) at <em>(3,61)</em>
          </p>
          <p>Inside Searing Gorge:</p>
          <p>
            Follow the trail north and then west around the area named &quot;The
            Cauldron&quot; and find Kalaran Windblade <em>(38,39)</em>. Get the
            quest <span className="quest">[48] Divine Retribution</span> then

            Go a bit further west and you should find a path going up the

        <li>
          First, go south where you'll find a big wheel (its part of a dark iron
          dwarven forge) and kill all the{' '}
          <span className="npc">Dark Iron Steamsmith</span> you find there{' '}
          <em>(39,50)</em>, there should be 5 or 6 around here. Hopefully one of
          them will drop the <TtLink id="18959">Smithing Tuyere</TtLink> you
          need. If not, lets just go on, we'll come back here later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start heading east and kill any <strong>elemental</strong> or{' '}
          <span className="npc">Heavy War Golem</span> you find on the way. Also
          kill <span className="npc">Dark Iron Taskmasters</span> and{' '}
          <span className="npc">Dark Iron Slavers</span> on your way. Don't wait
          for respawns, just kill them while going east. At <em>(59,35)</em>{' '}
          mount up and ride southeast to Grimesilt Dig site and find a little
          wooden house at <em>(65,62)</em> behind the dig site, which actually
          looks like some public toilet. Right click it and get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[45] Caught!</span>.
          <p>
            Start killing the <strong>Dark Iron dwarves</strong> in the camp as
            well as the <strong>golems</strong> around here. After you have
            killed 8 <span className="npc">Dark Iron Gelologists</span> and got
            15 <TtLink id="4306">Silk Cloth</TtLink> (if you don't have them,
            kill more of those dwarves, they drop silk cloth), go back to the
            Wooden Outhouse and turn in the quest, don't get the follow up
            though.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now go back to the digsite, and clear it entirely, especially the
          northern part. Get full HP/Mana and get the quest from Dorius
          Stonetender <span className="quest">[48] Suntara Stones</span>.
          <p>
            At <em>(66,44)</em> he will stop to catch his breath and will get
            ambushed by 4 lvl 43{' '}
            <span className="npc">Dark Iron Steelshifters</span>. Easy fight for
            you but make sure you get at least all but one off Dorius quickly so
            that he doesn't die.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <em>(74,19)</em> he will get assassinated (you can't help it) and
            a parchment will appear on the floor next to him.

          <p>
            {' '}
            Click it and turn in the quest, get the follow up{' '}

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ride north to the entrance of The Cauldron <em>(63,38)</em>. Inside
          the Cauldron, kill all the <strong>Dark Iron dwarves</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>Elementals</strong> you find.{' '}
          <strong>The Blazing Elementals</strong> and the{' '}
          <strong>Magma Elementals</strong> drop the{' '}
          <TtLink id="10509">Heart of Flame</TtLink> you need. Also kill any{' '}
          <strong>Heavy War Golem</strong> you find.
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> If while killing dwarves you find a{' '}
            <TtLink id="11818">Grimesilt Outhouse Key</TtLink>, right click it
            to start the quest{' '}
            <span className="quest">[47] The Key to Freedom</span>, we will turn
            it in later on.{' '}
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Progress westwards inside the Cauldron until you find an iron slope
          going up at <em>(46,53)</em>. Follow this slope until you find an
          entrance to the Slag Pit at <em>(41,54)</em>.
          <p>
            <img src="/assets/wp/theslagpit.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the slag pit go across the bridge, on your left will be the
            Quarry Gate, go through it.
            <br />
            Work your way northwards until a bigger room where you'll find{' '}
            <span className="npc">Enslaved Archeologists</span> and a big{' '}
            <strong>52 Elite elite golem</strong> lying down (ignore it). Go up
            the iron slope, midway on the slope you have 2 options, straight or
            left. Go straight. You'll soon enter a room with several pairs of{' '}
            <strong>taskmasters</strong> and <strong>slavers</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this room further in and to the right you'll find{' '}
            <span className="npc">Overseer Maltorius</span> and{' '}
            <span className="npc">2 Dark Iron Sentries</span>. These are 3
            elites so you can't solo them. You can either try to find more
            people (I managed to duo it with mage + paladin) or just abandon
            this quest. However, behind these 3 elites you can find{' '}
            <TtLink id="18922">Secret Plans: Fiery Flux</TtLink>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to click the plan and not be interupted for 6 seconds. So
            how do you do this? Well several classes can't do it, Paladins for
            example. Some can, like mage:
          </p>
          <p>
            Sheep the overseer, let the 2 sentries come to you, Iceroot them,
            run for the scroll and loot it fast, then jump down the ledge behind
            the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or warlock, hunter: Send in the pet, quickly loot the scroll and
            jump down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or warrior: charge the Taskmaster, and use intimidating shout. Loot
            the scroll quickly and jump down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engineers can probably make it too if they got a high level target
            dummy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, that's if you can't find people to kill those 3 elites with
            you, so try to find people for it and in the meantime you can go on
            with the other quests inside the Slag Pit. Better try it with 2
            other people, its a tough fight because Overseer is a mage and casts
            polymorph. If you got paladin or priest they can dispell it. Best is
            to sap/sheep Overseer and kill the 2 sentries first, then deal with
            the overseer alone.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          From the same big room, go over the iron bridge which is on the
          opposite side of the 3 elites. On the other side of the bridge, jump
          down to the lower floor at the drop off spot indicated on the map.
          From this spot go east and you should find{' '}
          <span className="npc">Incendosaurs</span>, kill 20 of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          When done with that, go back up the ramp and then get out of the Slag
          pit, jump down back into the Cauldron and work your way westwards
          looking for <span className="npc">Blaze Elementals</span> until you
          get 4 <TtLink id="10509">Heart of Flame</TtLink>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go to the iron slope you took previously at <em>(46,53)</em>{' '}
          Follow this slope but this time skip the first entrance to the slag
          pit, and get on the elevator <em>(40,54)</em>. The elevator will stop
          at the 1st floor and 2nd floor but don't get off. Wait until it's on
          the 3rd floor from there you can get out of the Cauldron.
          <p>
            Kill every <span className="npc">Steamsmith</span> you find around
            the buildings infront and to the left of you after getting off the
            elevator <em>(39,50)</em>. There is 5 Steamsmiths at this spot, pray
            that one of them drops a smithing Tuyere. If not don't worry, we'll
            kill more of these later.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Kill every <span className="npc">Heavy War Golem</span> around and go
          north to Karalan Windblade <em>(39,38)</em>. Turn in the quest and get
          the follow up <span className="quest">[48] Forging the Shaft</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to thorium point and turn in the quests you have completed. When
          turning in <span className="quest">[50] What the Flux?</span>, Master
          Smith Burninate will open 3 new quests to you, but they are just to
          work on thorium brotherhood faction, so don't bother unless you care
          about this faction.
          <p>
            You should be{' '}
            <em>
              <strong>level 51</strong>
            </em>{' '}
            by now, if not you should grind on{' '}
            <strong>dark iron dwarves</strong> in the slag pit for exemple to
            catch up.
