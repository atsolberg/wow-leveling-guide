            It's gonna take a while. But anyway this is good because you are
            working on our cenarion faction (which is very good at level 60 for
            many reasons,{' '}

            which can be traded for tickets at the{' '}

          <p>
            While killing Twilight mobs, you will sometimes find{' '}

            Keep them, you will need them later on for level 60 faction quests

            <span className="strong">Things to be careful with:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't touch the greater wind stones or you'll get nuked by it. These
            stones are to be used while wearing the full twilight cultist set
            and only when doing specific quests. Don't bother with them for now.
            <br />
            Avoid <span className="strong">Twilight Keeper Havunth</span>, he
            hurts a lot and doesn't drop anything particular.
            <br />
            The Scorpids you need to kill are the grey/green ones,{' '}
