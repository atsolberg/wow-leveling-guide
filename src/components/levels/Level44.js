          <p>
            Don't take the escort quest if you are solo, it's too hard for
            almost every class. If you are a duo or more, read the following
            warnings before taking the escort quest:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>1st Warning:</strong> The Chicken robot is stupid and
                doesn't assist you all the time if you get attacked. Let him in
                the front so he gets the first hit. He has a decent amount of
                HPs and heals back to full after each fight is over. You can
                even eat/drink a bit after a fight and let the chicken walk in
                the front (not too far away though). Don't even think about
                looting, you don't have time. Don't let the chicken tank more
                than one at a time, and don't let him tank too long either.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>2nd Warning</strong>: When out of the Yeti cave, the
                chicken will take a left turn and go towards the road, at some
                point 3 yetis will ambush him. Don't panic, you can let one of
                the yetis be tanked by the chicken at the beginning and deal
                with the other 2. Just check the chicken's health regularly.
                There will be a 2nd and a 3rd ambush, be prepared for them.
                Especially the last one is composed of 4 Gnolls.

            <em>(71,48)</em> you should be directly north of the small lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to the southeastern tip of that lake and a bit more to the south
            try to locate a small gnoll camp next to a huge tree.{' '}
            <em>(73,56)</em>. Clear the camp and look for{' '}
            <Object id="164953">Large Leather Backpack</Object> hanging at the
            trunk of that huge tree. Click it and get the follow up quest{' '}
