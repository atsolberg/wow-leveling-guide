          have the 6 quests:

          For those who don't do Sunken Temple, you will have to grind about
          80000-90000XP. That's approximately half a level. However there's
          plenty of good spots to grind at this level, and for good reasons:
          Harpies for your Darkmoon Epic Necklace or Deadwood Furlbogs for your
          Timbermaw faction.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you are done with Sunken Temple, turn in all the quests besides{' '}
