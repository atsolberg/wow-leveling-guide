            This might take a while but this is decent grinding since there's

            <strong>Note:</strong> This XP rate was just to show that with a

          Now you have two options:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1.</strong> Get a 5 man group together and go to Sunken
              Temple, which I highly recommmend because we got all the quests
              already, just have to pick{' '}
              <Quest id="1475">[50] Into the Temple of Atal'hakkar</Quest> from{' '}
              <Npc id="">Brohann Caskbelly</Npc> in Stormwind's dwarven district

              Hinterlands from the <Npc id="">Exile</Npc> or ask someone to
              share it. These quests will give a huge XP boost and the rewards
              are nice as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2.</strong> You don't want to do Sunken Temple, then I
              suggest you go grind in Azshara at the Blood Elf camp or on the
              Nagas on the Shattered Strands, OR kill deadwood Furlbogs in
              Northern Felwood to get neutral faction with the{' '}
              <strong>Timbermaw Tribe</strong> and being able to turn in the
              totem quest.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Before going to Sunken Temple, bind in Stormwind, then make sure you
          have the 6 quests:
          <br />
          <Quest id="1475">[50] Into the Temple of Atal'Hakkar</Quest>
          <br />
          <Quest id="3446">[51] Into the Depths</Quest>
          <br />
          <Quest id="3447">[51] Secret of the Circle</Quest>
          <br />
          <Quest id="4143">[52] Haze of Evil</Quest>
          <br />
          <Quest id="1446">[53] Jammal'an the Prophet</Quest>

      </ol>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For those who don't do Sunken Temple, you will have to grind about
          80000-90000XP. That's approximately half a level. However there's
          plenty of good spots to grind at this level, and for good reasons:
          Harpies for your Darkmoon Epic Necklace or Deadwood Furlbogs for your
          Timbermaw faction.
