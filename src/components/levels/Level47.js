            You can take the 2 follow ups (which appear lvl 55 but are still
            about the same mobs) if you feel like it and redo the quests several

            Silver and faction increase with all Steamwheedle Cartel factions
            per quest turn in, but on the other hand those elementals are kinda
            hard to kill with certain classes, so I'll let you be the judge

          <p>
            First <strong>go west</strong> to <em>(38,15)</em>, next to a thick
            square tower you'll find a dark gazebo, inside of it is the first
            flame, right click it. Loot the{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Go <strong>northeast</strong> to <em>(40,12)</em> to some big ruined
            arch, the 2nd flame is on the top of it in the middle. To get there
            you have to get behind the building and jump from stones to stones
            until you can reach the flame of Samha. Right click it and loot the{' '}
            <TtLink id="9257">Samha Essence</TtLink>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go back and jump down the building, directly northeast of it
            and on slightly higher ground among ruins you will find the flame of
            Imbel. <em>(39,9)</em> Loot the{' '}
            <TtLink id="9256">Imbel Essence</TtLink>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go southwest (ignore Shay Leafrunner for now if you see her)
            until <em>(37,11)</em>. The Flame of Lahassa is under a dark brown

            Now that you have all 4 essences, go <strong>southeast</strong> to
            the Equinex Monolith <em>(38,13)</em>. Clear some space around it,
            then go to it, search your bags for{' '}
            <TtLink id="9263">Troyas' Stave</TtLink>. Right click it to charge
            the stave, then right click the monolith, complete the quest, get
            the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[50] The Morrow Stone</strong>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Get out of the Monolith area and then clear yourself a path{' '}
            <strong>northwest</strong> to Shay Leafrunner. Before you take the
            quest, <em>here is the trick :</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            After taking the quest you must loot the bell from the chest next to
            Shay. Make a hotkey of that bell. Now here is the problem with Shay,
            she wanders off every now and then, she always says something like
            &quot;oh what a beautiful flower&quot; and goes away. When she does
            that you are supposed to ring the bell and she will run back to you.
            The problem is that the bell has a rather long cooldown so she ends
            up wandering off too often.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick is that{' '}
            <strong>
              as soon as you ring the bell, she will run to you, so you should
              start running southeast / south towards Rockbiter
            </strong>{' '}
            <em>(42,21)</em> and she will keep running after you until she
            catches up.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she catches up she will say something like &quot;I wandered off
            again, sorry&quot;. But the cooldown on the bell will be reset
            already.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>In short:</em>
            </strong>{' '}
            When she wanders off, ring the bell and run away, don't let her
            catch up to you. Even if you get aggroed by mobs keep running. Only
            stop if Shay herself gets attacked, then you will have to defend
            her. You can run and look behind you by holding your mouse's left
            click and moving the mouse, to make sure she's still running after
            you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once at the giant, turn in the quest. Then go southeast and back on
            the road, follow the road south and then east until <em>(54,41)</em>
            .
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now you can go south back into the Yeti Cave and try to escort the
            Homing Robot again if you didn't before. It's still really hard
            solo, but at level 47 I managed to do it (was extremely close with
            the mage though).
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend finding someone willing to duo it with you. Anyway, one
            advice, just <strong>ALWAYS</strong> let the chicken get hit first
            before you do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't manage to solo this quest or can't find a person to duo
            it just abandon it. It's really optional, but do try hard though.{' '}
