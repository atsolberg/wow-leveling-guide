            In Tanaris ride to the southeast until you reach{' '}
            <strong>Waterspring Field</strong> <em>(63,37)</em>. You will find
            numerous <strong>Wastewander</strong> camps there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kill <strong>Wastewander Rogues</strong> <em>(stealthers)</em>,{' '}
            <strong>Assassins</strong> and <strong>Shadow Mages</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also find <strong>Caliph Scorpidsting</strong>, he wanders
            between the tower structures, so you should go kill from a tower
            structure to another until you find him. He has 2 stealthed
            bodyguards, it will be a hard fight, burn him down quick and run
            away is my advice, use long cooldown abilities and potions if
            needed. Then go back and loot his head. If you don't find Caliph
            it's not a problem though, it's just some bonus XP quest, nothing
            important.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Once you got{' '}

              <strong>[44] More Wastewander Justice</strong>
            </span>{' '}
            completed, go east towards Lost Rigger Cove. You'll find a cave
            entrance at <em>(68,41)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go through this tunnel. Now you have a lot of work to do, check the
            kill list of{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[45] Southsea Shakedown</strong>
            </span>{' '}
            and start killing <strong>Pirates</strong>!<br />
            Clear your way south toward the main camp with the 3 houses , 2
            ships ashore and the boat under construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Andre Firebeard</strong> spawns at the campfire right in the
            center of the camp. He has 3 Dock Workers close to him but you can
            pull those 3 without him if you pull the back one, then you have
            Andre solo. Or you can burn him down fast and run away (or take them
            all).
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, this place is usually crowded because it is a good grinding
            spot, so you shouldn't have trouble getting help to kill Andre
            Firebeard if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go inside the first house to the right when entering the camp.
            You might get pulls of 3 at a time inside the house, you will maybe
            have to use the &quot;Kill one and run away&quot; tactic to get to
            the top floor of the house if you can't take 3 at a time.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            On the top floor are crates, click them to get{' '}
            <TtLink id="9244">Stoley's Shipment</TtLink>. Then keep on killing{' '}
            <strong>pirates</strong> until you complete Southsea Shakedown and
            Pirate Hats Ahoy!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Bonus: There is a rare spawn named <strong>Kregg Keelhaul</strong>{' '}
              on the boats ashore. Check for it.{' '}
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find a Captain's Key off one of the pirates, the chest is at
            the bottom level of the ship which is the most to the east.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing, while killing pirates by the dozen you might find a
            pirate footlocker on one of them (1% chance to drop approximately).
            In the footlocker you might find a note named &quot;Ship
            Schedule&quot;, right click it to start the quest{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[45] Ship Schedules</strong>
            </span>
            , which you turn in in Steamwheedle Port for an extra 4850 XP.
            However, you might be unlucky and never get a footlocker, so don't
            worry if you miss it, it's optional.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When done, get out of Rigger Cove and go north to Steamwheedle Port.
