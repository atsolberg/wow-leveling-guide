            So you just turned in all the quests you finished in Zul'Farrak
            (besides the one in Blasted Lands, cause we are going there now) or
            grinded your way up to level 49.

          <p>
            Those who did Zul'Farrak should have already 4 bubbles in level 49

            Ride out of Nethergarde Keep, go <strong>west / northwest</strong>{' '}
            until you find the two Blood Elves at <em>(50,14)</em>. Get all
            their quests:

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Start killing directly from here, you can find all the animals you
            need to kill for theses quests in the upper part of Blasted Lands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid the area around the Dark Portal and the Tainted Scar. Avoid
            anything that is level 52 or above. Kill pretty much everything on
            your way until you have all the quests completed.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Beware</strong> of the big drake flying around named{' '}
            <Npc id="">Teremus the Devourer</Npc>. Besides this, just kill
            everything{' '}

              ðŸ™‚
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What you'll need to kill the most though are{' '}
            <strong>vultures and basilisks</strong>, so here is a path you
            should follow, listing every possible Vulture spawn (there's also a
            few vulture roamers but you'll run into those too from time to time)
            so try to get all of them every cycle.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Completing all the quests will take a while, but here are a few
            tips:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Melees:</strong> As soon as possible try to finish the
                quest <Quest id="2585">[50] The Decisive Striker</Quest> and go
                turn it in, you'll get a +25 AGI buff for 1 Hour from{' '}
                <Item id="8412">Ground Scorpok Assay</Item>. When that buff
                wears out, go turn in either{' '}
                <Quest id="2581">Snickerfang Jowls</Quest> for{' '}
                <Item id="8410">R.O.I.D.S.</Item> or{' '}
                <Quest id="2583">A Boar's Vitality</Quest> for{' '}
                <Item id="8411">Lung Juice Cocktail</Item> depending on your
                preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Casters:</strong> As soon as possible try to finish the
                quest <Quest id="2583">A Boar's Vitality</Quest> and turn it in
                for <Item id="8411">Lung Juice Cocktail</Item>. Later on after
                your sta buff wears off, try to finish{' '}
                <Quest id="2601">[50] The Basilisk's Bite</Quest> for a{' '}
                <Item id="8423">Cerebral Cortex Compound</Item>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These buffs will help you killing faster, they do not stack, so wait
            for them to fade before you get the next one. Make good use of them{' '}
            <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
              ðŸ™‚
            </span>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            While killing mobs in Blasted Lands you might loot an{' '}
            <Item id="10593">Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment</Item> on one of
            them. Go to <Npc id="">Kum'Isha the Collector</Npc> <em>(51,35)</em>
            . Get the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="3501">[55] Everything Counts in Large Amounts</Quest> and
            turn it in. No need to get the follow up quest unless you get
            another Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment. If you are extremely lucky
            you'll find a <Item id="8244">Flawless Draenetyst Sphere</Item> In
            that case get the other quest from Kum'Isha and turn it in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Turn in all the other blasted lands quest when they are done, don't
            get the follow ups (they are repeatable if you want to get more of
            those nifty clickable buffs later on). Now you should be
            approximately 4 bubbles away from level 50 if you did this right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hearthstone to <strong>Ironforge</strong> (or to Hinterlands if you
            are still bound there).
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to Aerie Peak in Hinterlands, talk to{' '}
            <Npc id="">Gryphon Master Talonaxe</Npc>. (he's at the very top of
            Aerie Peak) Get the follow up{' '}
            <Quest id="2994">[53] Saving Sharpbeak (Elite)</Quest>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you got <strong>3 reasons</strong> to go to the top of{' '}
            <strong>Jintha'Alor</strong>. The Mallet of Zul'Farrak being one of
            them, but most importantly:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <Quest id="4787">[50] The Ancient Egg (Elite)</Quest> and
              </li>
              <li>
                <Quest id="2994">[53] Saving Sharpbeak (Elite)</Quest>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Build a group</strong> of level 50+ and go to{' '}
            <strong>Jintha'Alor</strong> <em>(66,66)</em>. It's doable with 3
            level 50s but it will be long and very tedious at the end, I suggest
            you try to fill up the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fight your way to the top of Jintha'Alor, then go to{' '}
            <Npc id="">Vile Priestess Hexx</Npc> <em>(59,78)</em>. She has one
            guard, you can wait till the Priestess wanders in the cave and get
            her guard solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then get the Priestess solo, kill her and loot the{' '}
            <Item id="9472">Hexx's key</Item> from her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also don't forget to forge the{' '}
            <Item id="9240">Mallet of Zul'Farrak</Item>, just click your Sacred
            Mallet while being next to the Altar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go inside the cave behind where you fought the Vile Priestess.
            Follow this path to find the Ancient Egg:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="/assets/wp/jintha1.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll find <Npc id="">Hitah'ya the Keeper</Npc> and 2 guards
            patrolling around the <Item id="12402">Ancient Egg</Item>. Kill
            Hitah'ya the Keeper first, should be a pushover for a group of 4 or
            5.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get the Ancient Egg. Once you have the Ancient Egg, clear the way
            out of the cave back to the Altar, from there go north towards the
            other cave at <em>(56,68)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kill the two trolls guarding it's entrance. Then go through the cave
            and on the other side of it you'll find <Npc id="">Sharpbeak</Npc>{' '}
            in it's cage. Free Sharpbeak and watch him fly away with his
            parents.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            You are done, hearthstone back to Aerie Peak and turn in the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="2994">[53] Saving Sharpbeak (Elite)</Quest>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also turn in any stacks of 5 Troll Tribal Necklaces you might have
            gotten during your Jintha' Alor trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go turn <Quest id="4787">[50] The Ancient Egg (Elite)</Quest> in
            Tanaris at Steamwheedle port, and get the follow up quest{' '}
            <Quest id="3528">[53] The God Hakkar (Dungeon)</Quest>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Turning in the quests will make you ding{' '}
            <em>
              <strong>level 50</strong>
            </em>{' '}
            or be very close, and you can go kill some trolls next to the Altar
            of Zul to finish your level, or some ogres in Tanaris. For those who
            didn't do Zul'Farrak: <em>Time to grind!</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ding level 50</strong>, and end of Chapter II.
