          <TtLink id="4389">Gyrochronatom</TtLink> from your bank (or buy them

        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the Hall of Explorers and get the quest{' '}

          <span className="quest">[39] Badlands Reagent Run</span> from Ghak

          Prospector Ironband <span className="quest">[38] Find Agmond</span>.
          Then go southwest to Badlands.

      </ol>
      <img src="/assets/wp/badlandsroute.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>In Badlands kill any Buzzard or Coyote you find on your way.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go south, past Hammertoe&apos;s Dig Site, until you find Prospector
          Ryedol and Sigrun Ironhew (53,43). Get quests:
          <br />
          <span className="quest">[35] A Dwarf and His Tools</span>
          <br />
          <span className="quest">[38] Mirages</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest and find Martek the Exiled (42,52) Turn in the quest and
          get follow up:
          <br />
          <span className="quest">[39] Indurium</span>
          <br /> also get quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[40] Barbecued Buzzard Wings</span> from
          Rigglefuzz.
          <br />
          Note: Whenever you need to sell or repair, go to this spot. There is a
          goblin smithing supplier and it&apos;s the only vendor and repairer in
          Badlands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west and a bit to the north until you find Lotwil
          Veriatus&apos;s Camp (25,44). Get quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Study of the Elements: Rock</span>
          <p>
            Get <span className="quest">[37] Coolant Heads Prevail</span>, turn
            it in, get the Follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">[37]Gyro...What?</span> and turn in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Just west of Lotwil Veriatus you will find a lot of Lesser Elementals.
          This is a very nice grinding spot, they are easy to kill and drop
          stones which you can stack up and sell to merchants for nice cash.
          (However, you should try to AH Solid stones, deeprock salt and
          Elemental Earth, they sell fairly nice at the Auction house). Stay at
          this spot until you get 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="4626">Small Stone Shard</TtLink> and hit level 39. If you
          don&apos;t like elementals, or if the spot is already overcrowded, go
          east to Angor Fortress, and kill Dwarves. For those who didn&apos;t go
          to Scarlet Monastery this will mean a long grinding session, but this
          will also mean good XP rate and cash (and you need to get your mount
          soon!). Go turn in{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Study of the Elements: Rock</span> at
          Lotwil Veriatus and get the follow up.
