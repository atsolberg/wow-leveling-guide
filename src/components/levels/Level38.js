          Just west of Lotwil Veriatus you will find a lot of Lesser Elementals.
          This is a very nice grinding spot, they are easy to kill and drop
          stones which you can stack up and sell to merchants for nice cash.
          (However, you should try to AH Solid stones, deeprock salt and
          Elemental Earth, they sell fairly nice at the Auction house). Stay at
          this spot until you get 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="4626">Small Stone Shard</TtLink> and hit level 39. If you
          don't like elementals, or if the spot is already overcrowded, go east
          to Angor Fortress, and kill Dwarves. For those who didn't go to
          Scarlet Monastery this will mean a long grinding session, but this
          will also mean good XP rate and cash (and you need to get your mount
          soon!). Go turn in{' '}
