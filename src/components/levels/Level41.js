          For those who didn't finish the <em>Stranglethorn Pages</em> yet: this

            Run out of Booty Bay and take the first way left until the Bloodsail
            Encampment by the shore. <strong>Pretty Boy Duncan</strong> should
            be there <em>(28,69)</em>. if not, keep clearing the camp until he
            appears. Kill Pretty Boy Duncan and loot{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            While you have the camp cleared, look for a map named{' '}

          <p>
            Then go back to the exit of Booty Bay but this time follow the trail
            to the north. A bit further on the right hand side of the road you
            will find <strong>Elder Mistvale Gorillas</strong> <em>(31,67)</em>.
            Kill Gorillas there until you get 5{' '}

            <em>Note:</em> Of course, I had XP rest bonus this time. I
            unfortunately logged my characters out in Ironforge after I finished
            the first Chapter of the guide. But still, if you divide it by two
            you still get a nifty 31000 xp / hour (actually more because the XP
            gained through turning in the quests isn't affected by XP bonus).
            Repair, sell and restock food/drink up to 3 stacks.

            Get out of Booty Bay and go east towards the shore named{' '}
            <em>Wild Shore</em>. From there, go southwards while killing any{' '}
            <strong>Bloodsails</strong> on the way until you reach the 1st camp{' '}
            <em>(29,80)</em>.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear the camp and look for a map thingy named{' '}
            <TtLink id="3920">&quot;Bloodsail Charts&quot;</TtLink> or{' '}
            <TtLink id="3921">&quot;Bloodsail Orders&quot;</TtLink>, If you
            don't find either, move on further south until you find a small boat
            ashore, check it for maps as well.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Careful, the Bloodsail Warlocks really hurt, make sure you interrupt
            their shadowbolts if you can, and kill them fast then deal with
            their pets. If you are Rogue or Mage though, I suggest sap /
            polymorph on the warlock first, kill the pet and then the warlock.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Now go further south until you find a bigger camp <em>(27,82)</em>.
            This camp will be harder to clear, but it's possible if you do it
            carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check the camp for Bloodsail Orders or Charts. Basically, the
            Bloodsail Charts and Orders can spawn at any of the two camps or at
            the boat. So check all three until you got both. Then wander up and
            down the shore where you came from and kill{' '}
            <strong>Bloodsails</strong> until you:

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kill 10{' '}
                <TtLink type="npc" id="1563">

              <li>
                Get 15 <TtLink id="3910">Snuff</TtLink> (can drop from any
                Bloodsail)
              </li>
              <li>
                Get <TtLink id="3897">Dizzy's Eye</TtLink> (can drop from any

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            When that is done, get back on the main road and go north until you
            reach <em>(39,41)</em>, slightly long ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              ** From this point on, if you find any{' '}
              <strong>Shadowmaw Panther</strong> (they are stealthed) make sure

          <p>
            At <em>(39,41)</em> go east and you will find{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Then go west to the other side of the road, you should find{' '}
            <strong>Jungle Stalkers</strong> <em>(34,37)</em>. Kill 10.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go northeast to <em>(36,35)</em> and kill{' '}
            <strong>Shadowmaw Panthers</strong> until you got 10 kills. You can
            find them in the area all around that big hill next to the tribal
            leatherworking troll NPC. They can be a bit hard to find sometimes
            because they are stealthers so I suggest you hit &quot;Tab&quot; key
            while running around and open your eyes well{' '}
            <em>(humans use your racial ability perception)</em>.{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Keep doing circles around that big hill and you will find 10
            panthers quickly. Kill anything on the way too while searching those
            panthers.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Go east to <strong>Ziata'Jai Ruins</strong> <em>(42,36)</em> and
            clear the camp of trolls. Be careful to avoid the patrols.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            When it's cleared, follow the little path northeast until you reach{' '}
            <strong>Balia'mah Ruins</strong> <em>(45,33)</em>. Kill all the
            trolls there as well. When this camp is clear, follow the path
            southeast and then south until you reach the ruins of{' '}
            <strong>Zul'Mamwe</strong> <em>(47,38 )</em> and kill all the trolls
            you find in the ruins (Though avoid the southernmost one up the
            plateau, the trolls there are higher level)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you run out of trolls go back to the first ruins of{' '}
