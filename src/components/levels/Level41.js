        already, of course).

        For those who didn't finish the <em>Stranglethorn Pages</em> yet: this
        is your last chance, check the Booty Bay AH and ask in general channel

        Run out of Booty Bay and take the first way left until the Bloodsail
        Encampment by the shore. <strong>Pretty Boy Duncan</strong> should be
        there <em>(28,69)</em>. if not, keep clearing the camp until he appears.
        Kill Pretty Boy Duncan and loot{' '}

      </p>
      <p>
        While you have the camp cleared, look for a map named{' '}

          Bloodsail Correspondence
        </TtLink>{' '}
        on one of the barrels, click it and get the follow up quest.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Go northwest across the bridge and keep going along the shore until you
        find some Nagas. Kill <strong>Naga Explorers</strong> at{' '}
        <em>(24,65)</em> until you get 10{' '}
        <TtLink id="4029">Akiris Reed.</TtLink>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go back to the exit of Booty Bay but this time follow the trail to
        the north. A bit further on the right hand side of the road you will
        find <strong>Elder Mistvale Gorillas</strong> <em>(31,67)</em>. Kill
        Gorillas there until you get 5{' '}

        Of course, I had XP rest bonus this time. I unfortunately logged my
        characters out in Ironforge after I finished the first Chapter of the
        guide. But still, if you divide it by two you still get a nifty 31000 xp
        / hour (actually more because the XP gained through turning in the
        quests isn't affected by XP bonus). Repair, sell and restock food/drink
        up to 3 stacks.

        <strong>Circuit 2:</strong>

      <p>
        Get out of Booty Bay and go east towards the shore named{' '}
        <em>Wild Shore</em>. From there, go southwards while killing any{' '}
        <strong>Bloodsails</strong> on the way until you reach the 1st camp{' '}
        <em>(29,80)</em>.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear the camp and look for a map thingy named{' '}
        <TtLink id="3920">"Bloodsail Charts"</TtLink> or{' '}
        <TtLink id="3921">"Bloodsail Orders"</TtLink>, If you don't find either,
        move on further south until you find a small boat ashore, check it for
        maps as well.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Careful, the Bloodsail Warlocks really hurt, make sure you interrupt
        their shadowbolts if you can, and kill them fast then deal with their
        pets. If you are Rogue or Mage though, I suggest sap / polymorph on the
        warlock first, kill the pet and then the warlock.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Now go further south until you find a bigger camp <em>(27,82)</em>. This
        camp will be harder to clear, but it's possible if you do it carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check the camp for Bloodsail Orders or Charts. Basically, the Bloodsail
        Charts and Orders can spawn at any of the two camps or at the boat. So
        check all three until you got both. Then wander up and down the shore
        where you came from and kill <strong>Bloodsails</strong> until you:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kill 10{' '}
            <TtLink type="npc" id="1563">
              Bloodsail Swashbucklers
            </TtLink>
          </li>
          <li>
            Get 15 <TtLink id="3910">Snuff</TtLink> (can drop from any
            Bloodsail)
          </li>
          <li>
            Get <TtLink id="3897">Dizzy's Eye</TtLink> (can drop from any
            Bloodsail)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        When that is done, get back on the main road and go north until you
        reach <em>(39,41)</em>, slightly long ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          ** From this point on, if you find any{' '}
          <strong>Shadowmaw Panther</strong> (they are stealthed) make sure you
          kill them **
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At <em>(39,41)</em> go east and you will find{' '}
        <strong>Venture Co. Goblins</strong> uphill. Kill them until you get 10{' '}
        <TtLink id="3917">Singing Blue Crystals</TtLink>.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go west to the other side of the road, you should find{' '}
        <strong>Jungle Stalkers</strong> <em>(34,37)</em>. Kill 10.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go northeast to <em>(36,35)</em> and kill{' '}
        <strong>Shadowmaw Panthers</strong> until you got 10 kills. You can find
        them in the area all around that big hill next to the tribal
        leatherworking troll NPC. They can be a bit hard to find sometimes
        because they are stealthers so I suggest you hit "Tab" key while running
        around and open your eyes well{' '}
        <em>(humans use your racial ability perception)</em>.{' '}
        <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
          🙂
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep doing circles around that big hill and you will find 10 panthers
        quickly. Kill anything on the way too while searching those panthers.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Go east to <strong>Ziata'Jai Ruins</strong> <em>(42,36)</em> and clear
        the camp of trolls. Be careful to avoid the patrols.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        When it's cleared, follow the little path northeast until you reach{' '}
        <strong>Balia'mah Ruins</strong> <em>(45,33)</em>. Kill all the trolls
        there as well. When this camp is clear, follow the path southeast and
        then south until you reach the ruins of <strong>Zul'Mamwe</strong>{' '}
        <em>(47,38 )</em> and kill all the trolls you find in the ruins (Though
        avoid the southernmost one up the plateau, the trolls there are higher
        level)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you run out of trolls go back to the first ruins of{' '}
        <strong>Ziata'Jai</strong> and repeat this cycle until you get 18{' '}
        <TtLink id="1524">Skullsplitter Tusk</TtLink> and{' '}
        <em>
          <strong>level 42</strong>
        </em>
        , this is a good grinding spot.
