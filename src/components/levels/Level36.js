      </ul>
      <p>
        We are not taking the quest{' '}
        <span className="quest">[35] Brutal Politics</span> because we decide to
        be friendly with the Gelkis Centaur Tribe which involves lowering
        faction with the Magram Centaurs. It doesn&apos;t really matter anyway
        if the Magram centaurs hate you.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Let&apos;s start with{' '}
          <span className="quest">[33] Reagents for Reclaimers</span>, kill
          Hatefury Satyrs in Sargeron, southeast of Nigel&apos;s Point (75,20).
        </li>
        <li>
          When you got 10 <TtLink id="6246">Hatefury Claws</TtLink> and 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="6247">Hatefury Horns</TtLink> go west to the area just
          north of Thunder Axe Fortress (56,17) you will find a ruined caravan
          there. Look for <span className="object">Malem Chest</span>. It&apos;s
          not actually a chest, rather a crate. Open it, get the follow up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go back to Nijel&apos;s Point and get the follow up. Turn in the Satyr
          quest as well but don&apos;t get the follow up (huge time waste). Sell
          and Repair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest and past Thunder Axe Fortress. Then go west towards the
          sea until you see a big tower. Azore Aldamort is next to the tower
          just north of it down the cliff (38,27). Get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[33] The Sceptre of Light</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          From there, go southwest to the shore towards (36,30), you should see
          the mast of a sunken ship. The Ravnitol Chest is on the shore at
          (36,30). Open it, and get the follow up quest. Right next to the chest
          is a black book named &quot;Rackmore&apos;s Log&quot;. Click it and
          get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[36] Claim Rackmore&apos;s Treasure</span>.{' '}
          <TtLink id="15878">Rackmore&apos;s Silver Key</TtLink> drops from
          Drysnap Pincer or Crawler.{' '}
          <TtLink id="15881">Rackmore&apos;s Gold Key</TtLink> drops from any
          Slitherblade Naga. Take a swim and kill Drysnaps around the ship until
          you get a Silver Key. It takes about 10 kills on average. Then further
          north go kill Siltherblade Nagas until you get a gold key. 10 kills on
          average as well to get a Golden Key.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have both keys, go east to the Thunder Axe Fortress. Enter
          the fortress through the main gate (56,30), go kill the Seer (he has
          one guard) on top of the 1st watch tower to the left past the gates.
          Loot the Sceptre of Light.
          <br />
          Then go in the big building and talk to Dalinda, get the follow up
          quest <span className="quest">[33] Search for Tyranis</span>. Tyranis
          is in the other building (the smaller of the two), southwest of the
          main one. Kill Tyranis and loot the pendant.
          <br /> Go back to Dalinda. Before you talk to her, clear the whole
          building. After you talk to her she will start to walk out of the
          fortress, escort her and make sure she doesn&apos;t die. <br />
          Warning: Dalinda is one of those stupid escort NPCs who don&apos;t
          stop when YOU are attacked. So let her in the front and make sure she
          gets hits first. Once out of the fortress she will run away and you
          will get a &quot;Quest Complete&quot; message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go northeast and back to Nijel&apos;s Point, turn in quests, get
          follow up <span className="quest">[39] The Karnitol Shipwreck</span>.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Go south to Kormek&apos;Hut (62,38). Get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[39] Bone Collector</span> (62,39) from Bibbly
          F&apos;utzbuckle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west to the big tower and turn in your quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[33] The Sceptre of Light</span> to Azore
          Aldamort. Get the follow up{' '}
          <span className="quest">[38]Book of the Ancients</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go northwest and take a swim towards the Ranazjar Isle. Clear the
          eastern shore of the isle. You should find a chest in between a tree
          and the white building. Click it to complete{' '}
          <span className="quest">[36] Claim Rackmore&apos;s Treasure</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then clear yourself a path through the Nagas so that you can reach the
          statue on the northwestern part of the isle (28,6). Clear the way
          around the statue, get full health/mana and go click the statue twice.
          Lord Kragaru will spawn, a lvl 38 Naga. Kill it (soloable at 36) and
          loot the <TtLink id="15803">Book of the Ancients</TtLink>. Before you
          go, kill Slitherblade Tidehunters and Slitherblade Sea Witches until
          one of them drops <TtLink id="6245">Karnitol&apos;s Satchel</TtLink>.
          Takes 15 kills on average (Took me only 4 once, and another time it
          took 29 kills).
        </li>
        <li>Swim back to Azore Aldamort get your rewards.</li>
        <li>
          Now go southeast towards the Kodo Graveyard (48,55). Gather 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="13703">Kodo Bones</TtLink> there, kill the Carrion
          Vultures if they are in the way. When you loot a bone there&apos;s a
          50% chance a lvl 37-38 Kodo Apparition will pop up and attack you. You
          can run away or deal with it, up to you, they disappear after about 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you got 10 <TtLink id="13703">Kodo Bones</TtLink>, run east to
          Scrabblescrew Camp (60, 61) and get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[34] Kodo Roundup</span>. Go back to the Kodo
          Graveyard and use the Kombobulator Rod on any Ancient, Aged or Dying
          Kodo. Once you have one tamed, run back with it to the goblin, then
          right-click on the tamed kodo. Rinse and repeat 5 times to complete
          the quest.
        </li>
        <li>
          When done with that, go southeast to the Magram Village (70,70) and
          kill centaurs until you are friendly with the Gelkis (exactly 50
          Kills, 46 if you are human). You can check your reputation with the
          Gelkis Centaur Clan by opening your character panel (&quot;C&quot;
          key) and clicking on the reputation tab or just directly press
          &quot;U&quot; key. After those 50 Kills you should also have 15{' '}
          <TtLink id="6067">Centaur Ears</TtLink> by now, if you don&apos;t,
          just kill some more centaurs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        At this point you should be level 37 already. If not, you should keep on
        grinding on Centaurs until you hit level 37.
