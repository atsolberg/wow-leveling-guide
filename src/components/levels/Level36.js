          In detail: From Ratchet, follow the road to the west until you reach
          Stonetalon Mountains. In Stonetalon Mountains follow the road
          west/northwest until you are past Sunrock Retreat and reach Mirkfallon
          Lake, keep following the road until you can go west in between two
          cliffs. Follow this path, go south through the charred vale and you
          will arrive in Desolace.

        further southwest until loc (67,16).
      </p>
      <p>Talk to the Hyppogryph master.</p>
      <p>Then get quests:</p>

        <TtLink type="quest" id="1385">
          [35] Brutal Politics

        because we decide to be friendly with the Gelkis Centaur Tribe which
        involves lowering faction with the Magram Centaurs. It doesn't really
        matter anyway if the Magram centaurs hate you.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let's start with{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="1458">
            [33] Reagents for Reclaimers
          </TtLink>
          , kill Hatefury Satyrs in Sargeron, southeast of Nigel's Point
          (75,20).
        </li>
        <li>
          When you got 10 <TtLink id="6246">Hatefury Claws</TtLink> and 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="6247">Hatefury Horns</TtLink> go west to the area just
          north of Thunder Axe Fortress (56,17) you will find a ruined caravan
          there. Look for <span className="object">Malem Chest</span>. It's not
          actually a chest, rather a crate. Open it, get the follow up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go back to Nijel's Point and get the follow up. Turn in the Satyr
          quest as well but don't get the follow up (huge time waste). Sell and
          Repair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest and past Thunder Axe Fortress. Then go west towards the
          sea until you see a big tower. Azore Aldamort is next to the tower
          just north of it down the cliff (38,27). Get the quest{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="5741">
            [33] Sceptre of Light
          </TtLink>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          From there, go southwest to the shore towards (36,30), you should see
          the mast of a sunken ship. The Ravnitol Chest is on the shore at
          (36,30). Open it, and get the follow up quest. Right next to the chest
          is a black book named "Rackmore's Log". Click it and get the quest{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="6161">
            [36] Claim Rackmore's Treasure
          </TtLink>
          . <TtLink id="15878">Rackmore's Silver Key</TtLink> drops from Drysnap
          Pincer or Crawler. <TtLink id="15881">Rackmore's Gold Key</TtLink>{' '}
          drops from any Slitherblade Naga. Take a swim and kill Drysnaps around
          the ship until you get a Silver Key. It takes about 10 kills on
          average. Then further north go kill Siltherblade Nagas until you get a
          gold key. 10 kills on average as well to get a Golden Key.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have both keys, go east to the Thunder Axe Fortress. Enter
          the fortress through the main gate (56,30), go kill the Seer (he has
          one guard) on top of the 1st watch tower to the left past the gates.
          Loot the Sceptre of Light.
          <br />
          Then go in the big building and talk to Dalinda, get the follow up
          quest{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="1439">
            [33] Search for Tyranis
          </TtLink>
          . Tyranis is in the other building (the smaller of the two), southwest
          of the main one. Kill Tyranis and loot the pendant.
          <br /> Go back to Dalinda. Before you talk to her, clear the whole
          building. After you talk to her she will start to walk out of the
          fortress, escort her and make sure she doesn't die. <br />
          Warning: Dalinda is one of those stupid escort NPCs who don't stop
          when YOU are attacked. So let her in the front and make sure she gets
          hits first. Once out of the fortress she will run away and you will
          get a "Quest Complete" message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go northeast and back to Nijel's Point, turn in quests, get follow up{' '}

          <TtLink type="quest" id="5501">
            [39] Bone Collector
          </TtLink>{' '}
          (62,39) from Bibbly F'utzbuckle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west to the big tower and turn in your quest{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="5741">
            [33] Sceptre of Light
          </TtLink>{' '}
          to Azore Aldamort. Get the follow up{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="6027">

          </TtLink>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go northwest and take a swim towards the Ranazjar Isle. Clear the
          eastern shore of the isle. You should find a chest in between a tree
          and the white building. Click it to complete{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="6161">
            [36] Claim Rackmore's Treasure
          </TtLink>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Then clear yourself a path through the Nagas so that you can reach the
          statue on the northwestern part of the isle (28,6). Clear the way
          around the statue, get full health/mana and go click the statue twice.
          Lord Kragaru will spawn, a lvl 38 Naga. Kill it (soloable at 36) and
          loot the <TtLink id="15803">Book of the Ancients</TtLink>. Before you
          go, kill Slitherblade Tidehunters and Slitherblade Sea Witches until
          one of them drops <TtLink id="6245">Karnitol's Satchel</TtLink>. Takes
          15 kills on average (Took me only 4 once, and another time it took 29
          kills).
        </li>
        <li>Swim back to Azore Aldamort get your rewards.</li>
        <li>
          Now go southeast towards the Kodo Graveyard (48,55). Gather 10{' '}
          <TtLink id="13703">Kodo Bones</TtLink> there, kill the Carrion
          Vultures if they are in the way. When you loot a bone there's a 50%
          chance a lvl 37-38 Kodo Apparition will pop up and attack you. You can
          run away or deal with it, up to you, they disappear after about 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you got 10 <TtLink id="13703">Kodo Bones</TtLink>, run east to
          Scrabblescrew Camp (60, 61) and get the quest{' '}
          <TtLink type="quest" id="5561">
            [34] Kodo Roundup
          </TtLink>
          . Go back to the Kodo Graveyard and use the Kombobulator Rod on any
          Ancient, Aged or Dying Kodo. Once you have one tamed, run back with it
          to the goblin, then right-click on the tamed kodo. Rinse and repeat 5
          times to complete the quest.
        </li>
        <li>
          When done with that, go southeast to the Magram Village (70,70) and
          kill centaurs until you are friendly with the Gelkis (exactly 50
          Kills, 46 if you are human). You can check your reputation with the
          Gelkis Centaur Clan by opening your character panel ("C" key) and
          clicking on the reputation tab or just directly press "U" key. After
          those 50 Kills you should also have 15{' '}
          <TtLink id="6067">Centaur Ears</TtLink> by now, if you don't, just
          kill some more centaurs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        At this point you should be level 37 already. If not, you should keep on
        grinding on Centaurs until you hit level 37.
