        No need to take the Green Hills of Stranglethorn quests (the one with
        the chapters), it will just encumber your quest log for now. You will
        complete each chapter when you get the right pages. So while you hunt
        always look out for these:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/assets/icons/inv-misc-note-06.jpg" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>Hunting</p>
      <p>
        <img src="/assets/wp/stvroute1.jpg" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: Kill River Crocolisks which can be found all along the river in
        northern Stranglethorn Vale until you find 2{' '}
        <TtLink id="4053">Large River Crocolisk Skin</TtLink>. While you search
        for crocs you can also kill Young Tigers close to the river for Tiger
        Mastery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Then kill 10 Young Tigers (or as much as you still got left)
        <br /> Tigers can be found mostly south and around the Nesingwary camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Kill Young Panthers, they are mostly found on the other side of
        the river to the east. (41,10).{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Go further northeast to the Kurzen Camp (44,11) and kill 15
        Kurzen Jungle Fighters as well as Kurzen Medecine Men until you get 7{' '}
        <TtLink id="2633">Jungle Remedies</TtLink> (might take a while). Also
        you&apos;ll need a <TtLink id="2634">Venom Fern Extract</TtLink> from
        one of the piles of crates scattered around the Kurzen Compound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5: Once all 4 quests are done go turn them in (besides Supply and
        Demand, which you will turn in later) at the Rebel Camp where you get
        the follow up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[38] Special Forces</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 6: And at the Nesingwary camp where you get the follow ups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[33] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[33] Panther Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Step 7: Go west until you reach a plateau (30,9). Up there you can find
        Panthers and Tigers. Kill 10 of each.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: Further southwest on the plateau you should find Stranglethorn
        Raptors, kill 10.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: Go south and down the plateau until you find the troll camp at
        Bal&apos;lal Ruins (29,20)
        <br /> It should take a while to get 15{' '}
        <TtLink id="1519">Bloodscalp Ears</TtLink> but it is a nice grinding
        spot anyway. So grind at this spot until you hit level 33. If you
        don&apos;t have enough trolls there is another camp northeast at the
        Tkashi Ruins (33,15).
