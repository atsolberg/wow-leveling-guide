            <strong>Homing Robot OOX-17/TN</strong> there. Turn in the quest.
            Get full health/mana, refresh buffs. Check if your long cooldown
            abilities are up. For some classes this will be hard to solo, so if
            you don't manage it better find someone to duo it with. If you don't
            manage that, just abandon the escort quest, it's optional anyway.

            <em>Things to know about this escort quest:</em>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Let the chicken in front, let him get hit first. Sometimes mobs
                will aggro him but not manage to hit him while he walks and they
                will just give up.
              </li>
              <li>
                The first part of the escort is the hardest as you will run into
                lvl 46-47 mobs. And at some point you will get an ambush of 3
                level 46 scorpions. Use your long cooldown abilities there.
                After this, it gets easier.
              </li>
              <li>
                Later on you will get a 2nd ambush, 3 humanoids lvl 42 (green).
                One will be a shadow mage though, kill it first.

            Which is why going through the pain of doing those 3 escort quests
            is in the end worth it. (Sadly the Tanaris beacon never dropped for
            the character I used to record the XP Rates, so I didn't get this

            Go back to <strong>Ironforge</strong>. Now here is what I advise:
            Get a group together and go to <strong>Zul'Farrak</strong>. It would
            be a waste not to go, you already have all the pre-quest work done,
            you just have to gather a few more quests in Tanaris (and one in
            Dustwallow Marsh).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you don't like instances, I really suggest you do an effort
            on this one, it will be a great XP boost and you also get follow up
            quests which will be another source of extra XP later.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              You don't even have to do everything in Zul'Farrak. You can skip
              Antu'Sul and Witch Doctor Zum'Rah, which are arguably the hardest
              battles in there.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also skip Gahz Ridian actually, but if you get someone in
            your group with the Mallet, you might as well go for it. Just make
            sure you do at least:
            <ul>
              <li>Kill Theka the Martyr (Get 1st Tablet)</li>
              <li>The Temple script (Loot Nekrum's Medaillon)</li>
              <li>Kill Hydromanther Velratha (Loot 2nd Tablet)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me just 2 Hours with a crappy pick-up group for a huge XP
            boost. <em>If you really don't want to go to Zul'Farrak:</em>

            You can abandon the quests related to it and go grind up to level
            49. (Because those who go to Zul'Farrak will ding 49 from turning in
            the quests even if they don't do all the quests, Gazh'Rilla and
            Troll Temper namely)

            You can grind either in Feralas on <strong>Yetis</strong> or on{' '}
            <strong>Harpies</strong> (good for Darkmoon Faire Tickets). You can
            also grind on <strong>ogres</strong> in Tanaris if you prefer.

              <em>For those who go to Zul'Farrak</em>
            </strong>
            , the optimal setup would be that one person of your group has{' '}
            <strong>the Mallet</strong> to summon <strong>Gahz'Rilla</strong>.
            If you can't manage that it's np, this is optional and you can
            always come back later when you have your own mallet, if you wish
            to.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases, when you stop by Tanaris, talk to Sprinkle and get
            the follow up <span className="quest">[49] Delivery for Marin</span>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Go talk to <strong>Marin Noggenfogger</strong> and get the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">[49] Noggenfogger Elixir</span> and turn it
            in. The elixirs are more fun than useful but sometimes they give
            nifty effects like levitation or water breathing, which can be
            helpful situationaly. Plus now you can buy Elixirs from Marin at
            will{' '}

            You can also bind in Gadgetzan or anywhere you please if it's more
            convenient to you, for now.
