      <p>Let's start with some Murloc slaughtering!</p>
      <p>
        Step 1: The murlocs are right next to the town on the western shore.
        Kill 10 Tidehunters and 10 Oracles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Go turn it in and get the follow up. Go back and kill more
        murlocs until you get 10 <TtLink id="3716">Murloc Heads</TtLink>.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Go turn in the quest, get the follow up. Speak with Marshal
        Redpath in Southshore, get follow up and talk to Lieutenant Fahren
        again. Get the follow up{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="562">
          [32] Stormwind Ho!
        </TtLink>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sell and repair (there's an armorsmith behind a small house next to the
        inn)
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Time to hunt Nagas now. The ones you need are on the eastern
        shore, right next to the town. Kill 10 Daggerspine Shorehunters and 10
        Daggerspine Sirens, go back to Southshore and talk to Lieutenant Farren
        again and get the follow up{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="563">
          [32] Reassignment
        </TtLink>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5: Now take a flight path to Refuge Pointe (Arathi Highlands). In
        Refuge Pointe get the quest{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="691">
          [36] Worth its Weigh in Gold
        </TtLink>{' '}
        from Apprentice Kryten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 6: Go southeast until you reach the Go'Shek Farm (60,53) and find
        the NPC named Quae, she is looking over the Go'Shek Farm from the
        northwest edge. Talk to her and take the follow up quest{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="657">
          [36] Hints of a new Plague?
        </TtLink>
        . You need to find and kill a Forsaken Courier and loot a{' '}
        <TtLink id="4482">Sealed Folder</TtLink> from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short</strong>: The Forsaken Courier roams from the Go'Shek
        Farm all along the road up until the wall to Hillsbrad Foothils. He is
        lvl 35 and doesn't have that much hit points, but he has 4 level 35
        bodyguards. Find a way to kill and loot the Courier. You can do it solo
        at level 35, I've done it with 5 different classes and I've heard about
        other players doing the same. For instructions on how to kill the
        courier with a certain class, see below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In Details</strong> Now you need to find and kill the Forsaken
        Courier, he roams from the Go'Shek Farm all along the road up until the
        wall to Hillsbrad Foothils. He has 4 bodyguards, all level 35. <br />
        There are many ways to kill it though, even solo at level 35.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Warrior: for example, charge the Courier, hit Retaliate, use
          Intimidating Shout, kill the courier fast, loot it and then run away.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mage, burn him down as fast as possible, start from max range with
          Pyroblast if you got it, use ice root on the bodyguards, finish the
          Courier fast. Use a Health Potion if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rogue, you can single the courier out. Use Distract so that only one
          guard stops while the rest keeps walking, then kill the guard solo,
          rinse and repeat until you get the courier solo. You can also just
          rush in the pack, hit Evasion and kill the courier quickly before
          evasion runs out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warlock and Hunter: Send in the pet and burn the Courier as fast as
          possible while your pet dies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Priest: Powerword:Shield and Renew yourself, be at max range, start
          with Smite, then a Mind Blast while the mobs run to you, then a Shadow
          Word:Pain. The bodyguards should be on you at this moment, use Psychic
          Scream, and keep on burning the Courier with Mind Flay / Mind Blast.
        </li>
        <li>Paladin Just go for the courier and use your invulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There must be a way for each class to solo this at level 35, use
        creativity, potions, and long cooldown abilities. If you don't manage
        it, try to get a partner to duo it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 7: Once you got the <TtLink id="4482">Sealed Folder</TtLink> from
        the Forsaken Courier, go back to Quae (60,53). Turn in and get the
        follow up{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="660">
          [37] Hints of a new Plague?
        </TtLink>
        , where you have to escort Kinelory.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the escort, one word of advice: Let Kinelory be in the front, always
        walk behind her, when mobs aggro her, help her take them out one by one.
        And make sure they don't run far. Kinelory is quite a tank and can also
        heal a bit. If you let her be in front and don't let runners create
        trains, you will complete the quest easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: When completed, talk to Quae and get the follow up. Then go
        southeast of Go'Shek Farm to the troll village (63,65).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kill trolls until you get 10 <TtLink id="4503">Witherbark Tusks</TtLink>
        . Kill Witch Doctors until you get 4{' '}
        <TtLink id="4522">Witherbark Medicine Pouch</TtLink>. Further inside the
        village and to the south (68,75) you will find a cave. Inside the cave
        you will find Witherbark Shadow Hunters and get the{' '}
        <TtLink id="5040">Hunter Knife</TtLink> you miss to complete the quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: Once completed, run back to Refuge Pointe in Arathi and turn in
        the troll quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearthstone to Southshore, and talk to Phin Odelic and complete the
        quest "Hints of a New plague".
      </p>
      <p>Sell and repair.</p>
      <p>
        Step 10: Go north and follow the road north until you zone to Alterac
        Mountain (96,47). A bit further up and to the right you will find
        Soferan's Naze (58,67). Clear the Syndicate camp there, and in the
        middle of the camp on a table you should find parchments named
        "Syndicate Documents". Right click one of them and get the two quests{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="511">
          [34] Encrypted Letter
        </TtLink>{' '}
        and{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="510">
          [34] Foreboding Plans
        </TtLink>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go northwest towards the snowy mountains where you will find
        Crushridge Ogres, they drop the{' '}
        <TtLink id="2843">Dirty Knucklebones</TtLink> you need. <br /> When you
        run short on ogres, you can go to the southwest where you will find the
        area called "Corrahn's Dagger" (47,76). There you can kill Syndicate
        Footpads and Syndicate Thieves as well as Mountain Lions and Hulking
        Mountain Lions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest you go back and forth from this spot to the ogres whenever you
        run short on mobs. Do this until the Ogre and Syndicate quests are
        completed. Then there's more Lions further to the west at "The Headland"
        (38,55).
      </p>
      <p>
        You should keep going westwards while killing lions until you complete
        your quest. At this point you should be close to level 36, if not, grind
        on ogres / syndicates until you are about 2 bubbles away from level up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: Go northwest towards Dalaran until you reach Archmage Ansirem
        (18,78). Turn in the quest{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="602">
          [37] Magical Analysis
        </TtLink>{' '}
        and get the follow up{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="603">
          [37] Ansirem's Key
        </TtLink>
        . Then warp to Southshore or run there if Hearthstone isn't ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turn in the 5 quests in Southshore. Get the follow up{' '}
        <TtLink type="quest" id="514">
          [34] Letter to Stormpike
        </TtLink>{' '}
        from Loremaster Dibbs. Don't get the other follow ups.
        <br /> Congratulations on level 36.
