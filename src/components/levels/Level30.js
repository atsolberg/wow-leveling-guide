          <strong>In Short</strong>: Go to <strong>Theramore</strong> by boat,
          in <strong>Theramore</strong> learn the new flight path, go to the
          Inn, make it your home location, then go to Thousand Needles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In Details</strong>: From <strong>Ironforge</strong>, take a
          flight path to <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong>, if you don&apos;t
          have that flight path, you&apos;ll have to go to wetlands and then run
          to <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong>. In{' '}
          <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong> take the boat to{' '}
          <strong>Theramore</strong> (It is the boat that stops at the southern
          peer). When in <strong>Theramore</strong>, find the Gryphon Master and
          get the flight path. Then go to the Inn, talk to the innkeeper and
          make theramore your home location. After that, go through Dustwallow
          Marsh by following the road northwest and then south to the Barrens.
          When in the Barrens, go south to <strong>Thousand Needles</strong>, go
          down the great lift (don&apos;t attack the guard just run past him,
          take the elevator and keep going until he forgets you).
        </li>
      </ul>
      In <strong>Thousand Needles</strong>, go west until you reach the border
      of <strong>Feralas</strong>, and find the alliance outpost:{' '}
      <strong>Thalanaar</strong> (5,17). Get the new flight path from there.
      <p>
        Go southeast along the mountain, keep going until you hit Roguefeather
        Den (27,51). It&apos;s grinding time! Don&apos;t worry, there will be a
        lot of questing after that, but you are gonna kill these harpies until
        those two goals are achieved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you hit level 31+</li>
        <li>
          you obtain 25 <TtLink id="5117">Vibrant Plumes</TtLink>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The harpies are lvl 28-30, drop cash and silk cloth. There are a lot of
        them and they respawn fast. (Make sure to kill the harpies that are down
        on the ground and those that are in the cave up on the hill) With the 25{' '}
        <TtLink id="5117">Vibrant Plumes</TtLink> you can get 60 Tickets at the
        Darkmoon Faire, you can then trade 50 Tickets for a 14 Slot Bag, which
        is a big plus at this level (unless you are a twink). Sadly the Darkmoon
        Faire is not always available, check this{' '}

        to know when the Darkmoon Faire will be available, and put your{' '}
        <TtLink id="5117">Vibrant Plumes</TtLink> in bank until then. If you
        don&apos;t want the bag, you can either auction those plumes (they sell
        nicely) or save them up for your future epic necklace.
