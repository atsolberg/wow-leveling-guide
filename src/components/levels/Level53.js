          In the blood elf camp you'll find several crates named{' '}
          <strong>"Kim'Jael's Equipment"</strong> scattered around. Open them
          all, most of the time you'll find food in it, but 25% of the time
          you'll find <Item id="10717">Kim'Jael's compass</Item>,{' '}
          <Item id="10715">scope</Item>, etc. You'll get them by pair of 2. So
          basically you just need to find 2 "good" crates and you are done.

        <li>
          Once you got the quest complete and have approximately 25000 xp in

            You'll encounter some <strong>naga</strong> pretty soon, kill every{' '}
            <strong>naga</strong> on your way, go southwest, until you reach the
            Ruins of Eldarath by a path at <em>(41,48)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            South of it, at <em>(39,50)</em> you'll find a Pillar named Rune of
            Jin'yael, clear the <strong>2 ghosts</strong> guarding it and any
            naga close to it. Right click the pillar, it will use your drawing

            Grind your way through nagas back from where you came from until the
            path leading to the Shattered Strand at <em>(45,47)</em>. Consider
            this as a mini grinding session, because these nagas go down easily
            and there is a lot of them = good grind spot.{' '}

            You should find <Item id="13815">Some Rune</Item> on one of the

          This time don't kill the nagas, just ride along the shore directly
          south, avoiding nagas as much as possible and keep going until you hit
          a spot where you can't go further without having to swim{' '}

          Swim east and then south to the island marked on the map{' '}
