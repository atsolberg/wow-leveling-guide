            At this point if you can find people to group it will be much
            easier. Dousing the Flames of Protection is doable solo (but kinda
            hard), on the other hand there's an escort quest which is almost
            impossible solo, at least for most classes. It also depends on how
            crowded the area is, if there's lots of people farming in the shadow
            hold already, it's doable solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear your way down the first tunnel, in the first room you'll find
            a captured elve named <span className="strong">Arko'narin</span>.
            This is the NPC that gives the escort quest, but to get it you first
            need to find a <span className="item">Blood Red Key</span> from one
            of the mobs inside Shadow Hold, click it and get the quest{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <span className="strong">[55] A Stranged Red Key</span>
            </span>
            . You have to turn this quest at Captured Arko'narin later. The
            follow up will be the escort quest.

        </li>
        <li>
          In the same room you can find the{' '}

        <li>
          If you are in a group (at least a duo of lvl 55 people), and get a

            <span className="strong">Note:</span>
          </span>{' '}
          You have to click on the elf through the cage. Some people try to
          click the cage itself, but that doesn't work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Escort Arko'Narin to her equipment, then escort her out, things can
          get rough at times because she engages 2 or 3 lvl 55 mobs a the same
          time and is fragile until she has her equipment on. In the same room
          where her equipment is you'll find the{' '}
          <span className="strong">3rd and 4th Brazier</span>, turn them off
          too. At the exit{' '}
          <span className="em">a 53 Elite mob will attack you.</span>
          <p>
            Defeat it and then Arko'narin will leave and you'll get the quest
            complete message.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't find anyone to group with, just don't do the escort
            quest, clear your way inside the Shadow Hold and turn off the 4
            brazier.

            there, as we won't be needing them for a while. You can destroy
