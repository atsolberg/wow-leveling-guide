            this spot, kill all bears and wolves you find while going north,

          <p>
            At this point if you can find people to group it will be much
            easier. <Quest id="5165">Dousing the Flames of Protection</Quest> is
            doable solo (but kinda hard), on the other hand there's an escort
            quest which is almost impossible solo, at least for most classes. It
            also depends on how crowded the area is, if there's lots of people
            farming in the shadow hold already, it's doable solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear your way down the first tunnel, in the first room you'll find
            a captured elve named <Npc id="">Arko'narin</Npc>. This is the NPC
            that gives the escort quest, but to get it you first need to find a{' '}
            <Item id="13140">Blood Red Key</Item> from one of the mobs inside
            Shadow Hold, click it and get the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="5202">[55] A Strange Red Key</Quest>. You have to turn
            this quest at Captured Arko'narin later. The follow up will be the

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the same room you can find the{' '}

            <em>
              <strong>Note:</strong>
            </em>{' '}
            You have to click on the elf through the cage. Some people try to
            click the cage itself, but that doesn't work.

        </li>
        <li>
          Escort <Npc id="">Arko'Narin</Npc> to her equipment, then escort her
          out, things can get rough at times because she engages 2 or 3 lvl 55
          mobs a the same time and is fragile until she has her equipment on. In
          the same room where her equipment is you'll find the{' '}
          <strong>3rd and 4th Brazier</strong>, turn them off too. At the exit{' '}
          <em>a 53 Elite mob will attack you.</em>
          <p>
            Defeat it and then <Npc id="">Arko'narin</Npc> will leave and you'll
            get the quest complete message.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't find anyone to group with, just don't do the escort
            quest, clear your way inside the Shadow Hold and turn off the 4
            brazier.

          Once done with that, get back on the main road and follow it until

            Get back on the road follow it until Talonbranch Glade, sell and
            repair then go to Timbermaw Hold. In Timbermaw go to the
