      <h6>Level 33:</h6>
      <p>
        Step 10: From the troll camps, go west until you hit the shore, and move
        along the shore towards the north until you find Crystal Spine
        Basilisks. If you run short on Basilisks, there is more on the lower
        plateau to the east along the shore. If there aren&apos;t any basilisks
        just go kill some trolls until they respawn. Kill basilisks until you
        get 10 <TtLink id="3918">Singing Crystal Shards</TtLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: After that, take a swim westwards until you hit the island at
        loc (21,22), you will have to go towards the middle of the island so the
        quest <span className="quest">[37] The Stone of the Tides</span> is
        completed, but be careful with the lvl 37ish elementals on the isle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 12: When you completed all 6 quests, go turn in the 3 mastery
        quests at camp nesingwary and get the follow ups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Raptor Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[38] Panther Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check if you completed any of the chapters of the Stranglethorn pages
        quests as well and turn them in if you did.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter I</strong>: page 1,4,6,8
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter II</strong>: page 10,11,14,16
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter III</strong>: page 18,20,21,24
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter IV</strong>: page 25,26,27
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Make sure you repair and sell junk at the vendor before you go again.
        You will probably need a lot of space in your bags with the extra pages
        you will find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 13: Now you probably must be about halfway to level 34. It&apos;s
        time to go grind at Kurzen camp or on the Trolls, up to you. When you
        are 1 bubble away from lvl 34, warp to <strong>Booty Bay</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>. Turn in the following quests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[31] Supply and Demand</span> at Drizzlik in
          the &quot;Tan-your-hide-Leatherwork&quot; shop. It is situated on the
          top floor and not too far from the inn in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Singing Blue Shards</span> on the ground
          floor in bootay bay inn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Bloodscalp Ears</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Krazek&apos;s Cookery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[32] Investigate the Camp</span> on the 2nd
          floor of the booty bay inn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] The Stone of the Tides</span> on the top
          floor of <strong>Booty Bay</strong> inn to Baron Revilgaz.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This should make you level up.
      <p>Step 5: Get follow up quests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Some Assembly Required</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Water Elementals</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[41] Venture Company Mining</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: If some follow up quests aren&apos;t mentioned it is because they
        aren&apos;t worth the trouble. Just take the ones listed above.
