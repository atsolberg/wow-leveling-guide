        Step 10: From the troll camps, go west until you hit the shore, and move
        along the shore towards the north until you find Crystal Spine
        Basilisks. If you run short on Basilisks, there is more on the lower
        plateau to the east along the shore. If there aren't any basilisks just

          [37] The Stone of the Tides
        </TtLink>{' '}
        is completed, but be careful with the lvl 37ish elementals on the isle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 12: When you completed all 6 quests, go turn in the 3 mastery
        quests at camp nesingwary and get the follow ups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

          </TtLink>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check if you completed any of the chapters of the Stranglethorn pages
        quests as well and turn them in if you did.
      </p>

        Make sure you repair and sell junk at the vendor before you go again.

        you will find.
      </p>
