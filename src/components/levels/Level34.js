      <h6>Level 34:</h6>
      <p>
        Since you are lvl 34 now, go train if you wish to do so. Closest place
        to train is Stormwind by gryffon. (Unless you are a rogue, there&apos;s
        a rogue trainer on the 1st floor of <strong>Booty Bay</strong> inn).
      </p>
      <p>
        While you are on gryffon (or in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>), ask in
        general channel if anyone has any page you need, and trade your spare
        pages in exchange or just buy them, they go for 10-15 silver on average.
        You can also check the <strong>Booty Bay</strong> auction house for
        missing pages. I suggest you even buy them overpriced (Offer 20-30
        Silver for a page and you should get it quickly). The sooner you
        complete the page collection, the better for your bag space.{' '}
        <span role="img" aria-label="tongue">

        Anyway, time to hunt again!
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/assets/wp/stvroute2.jpg" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: When you are done, go back to the jungle, follow the road north
        until you hit loc (39,22). And go westwards (towards the area north of
        Grom&apos;Gol Camp). You should find plenty of Lashtail Raptors there.
        Kill them as much as needed for the quests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2 &amp; 3: When done with raptors, you should hit the river to the
        east and search along the banks for Snapjaw Crocolisks. At the same time
        you can start heading to the Venture co. Camp next to Lake Nazferiti and
        kill Geologists there (44,20), they drop the &quot;tumbled
        crystals&quot; you need for{' '}
        <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span>. You can find
        crocolisks on both sides of the river, all around Lake Nazferiti and all
        the way down to Mizjal Ruins. Keep killing Goblins and Crocolisks until
        you get both quests complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: When done with that, head northwest until you hit the area in
        between Bal&apos;al Ruins and Tkashi Ruins (33,15). There you wil find
        Elder Stranglethorn Tigers and kill 10 of them.
      </p>
      <p>Step 5: Once done, go to Nesingwary Camp and turn in </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Raptor Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Get the two follow ups and complete any chapter to get rid of pages taking
      up bag space.
      <p>
        Step 6: Go northeast until you hit the Kurzen Camp, this time go
        straight for the cave there and kill Commandos and Headshrinkers.
        Careful the Commandos are stealthers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 7: When done with that go southwest to find Sin&apos;dall.
        Sin&apos;dall is on top of a hill at (31,17) right in the middle of
        Bal&apos;al and Tkashi ruins. It is definitely soloable at lvl 34, just
        make sure all your long cooldown abilities are up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: Once Sin&apos;dall is dead, head west until you hit the island
        you discovered before (21,22), and kill Water Elementals there until you
        get 6 <TtLink id="3923">Water Elemental Bracers</TtLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: At this point you should be getting close to level 35. If you
        are not, grind on trolls until you are about 3 bubbles of XP away from
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 10: When that is done, go turn in your quests at the Nesingwary and
        Rebel camps, at the Rebel Camp get the folllow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[38] Kurzen&apos;s Mystery</span>. By now you
        should have completed your page collections or be close, if you
        aren&apos;t it&apos;s ok, we will be back in Stranglethorn Vale in about
        3 levels and then you ll for sure complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: Warp to <strong>Booty Bay</strong>, turn in the quests
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span> at Kebok (inn).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Water Elementals</span> at Baron Revilgaz
          on to of the Inn. Get follow up{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Magical Analysis</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Some Assembly Required</span> at Drizzlik
          (Leather-and-hide shop),
        </li>
      </ul>
      Don&apos;t get the follow up. Go to the bank and get the 10{' '}
      <TtLink id="3712">Turtle Meat</TtLink> you saved since Thousand Needles,
      and make space in your bags in case you still have Stranglethorn pages.
      <p>Time to travel!</p>
      <p>
        If you already know how to get there, go to Southshore in Hillsbrad
        Foothills (or take a Gryffon Ride)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don&apos;t know how to get there:
        <br /> Take a gryffon ride to Stormwind, then use the tram or gryffon to
        <strong>Ironforge</strong>, then gryffon ride to Southshore or Arathi.
        If you don&apos;t have those flight paths, fly to Wetlands. From
        Menethil in Wetlands follow the road east and then north until you zone
        into Arathi Highlands; keep going north until you reach Refuge Pointe
        (46,46). Get the flight path there. From Refuge Pointe take the road
        west until you reach Hillsbrad Foothills. In Hillsbrad Foothils follow
        the road west and then south at the 3rd fork. Southshore is at loc
        (50,55). Talk to the Gryphon Master in Southshore. and bind at the Inn.
        You should be level 35 or close by now.
