        <li>
          You really don't like Uldaman, then go to the next part of my guide,
          but that will mean more grinding for you. I strongly advice you to go
          to Uldaman though, you already have most of the pre-questing done,
          just need to gather a few missing quests quickly. And trust me, there
          will be big exp bonuses later on thanks to going to Uldaman.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>After Uldaman:</p>

            house.

          <p>
            From Ironforge, fly to Menethil Harbor (Wetlands). Take the boat to
            Auberdine, this boat is at the northern peer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once in Auberdine, get the flight path from the Hippogryph Master,
            then take the boat back to Menethil Harbor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then take the boat to Theramore, it's the boat that stops at the
            southern peer. In Theramore on the docks turn in the quest{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[43] Akiris by the Bundle</strong>

          <p>
            Talk to the Gryphon Master. If you have First Aid, you can do the
            quest to become master in First Aid there. You need to have a skill
            225 and be level 40. Go talk to Doctor Gustaf VanHowzen in the
            Foothold Citadel and do the little quest where you have to bandage
            patients and get 3900 easy XP.

              it and keep the quest. You'll find beacons in Feralas and
              Hinterlands as well, proceed equally with those. Each of those
              beacons start a quest where you will have to find a Homing Robot
              and escort it. The beacons won't always drop for you, they are
              kinda rare. The escort quests are hard to do solo especially for
              certain classes. But if you are lucky to find all 3 beacons you
              should really put the effort and finish all 3 rescue quests, it
              will be described when to do them in the guide later on. Anyway,
