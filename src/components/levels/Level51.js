          <em>(39,50)</em> and kill{' '}
          <span className="npc">Dark Iron Steamsmiths</span> again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west and then south, basically staying close to the cauldron
          but never going down in it. Kill every <strong>dwarf</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>golem</strong> on your way. Basically make circles around the
          cauldron. Also make sure you kill any{' '}
          <span className="npc">Greater Lava Spider</span> on sight.
          <p>
            There is alot of them in an area west of the cauldron{' '}
            <em>(28,47)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While doing circles around the cauldron, make sure you kill the{' '}
            <span className="npc">Dark Iron Lookouts</span> you can find at the
            feet of each of the 4 watch towers. They drop the spyglass you need

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyway, as soon as you got 8{' '}
          <TtLink id="10551">Thorium Plated Daggers</TtLink>, go back to Kalaran
          Windblade, even if you didn't finish the other quests yet.
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> The{' '}
            <TtLink id="10551">Thorium Plated Daggers</TtLink> can drop on any
            dark iron dwarf, it generally takes me a full turn around the
            cauldron to get 8 of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn in the quest at Kalaran Windblade and get the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">[50] The Flame's Casing (Elite)</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go kill the 5 <span className="npc">Dark Iron Steamsmiths</span> again
          before you go, if you haven't got the Smithing Tuyere yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now you should ask in Looking for Group channel if anyone is
          interested in doing{' '}
          <span className="quest">[50] The Flame's Casing (Elite)</span> and{' '}
          <span className="quest">[50] Prayer to Elune (Elite)</span> (we are
          gonna get this quest on the way soon).
          <p>
            You can duo these two quests but it might be a bit tough depending
            on the class mix you get. So if you find more it's even better.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't find people to help you immediatly, just keep on doing
            circles around the cauldron killing dwarves, giants and greater lava
            spiders while waiting on people to join your group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you got yourself a group (or at least one level 48+ partner). Go
          west to the Twilight camp at <em>(24,34)</em>. There is a cavern with{' '}
          <strong>Twilight mobs</strong> further to the west but don't go there,
          first you should go up a narrow path up the mountain. When you are up
          the path, you should face your first twilight mobs, they are all elite
          and lvl 48-50. Clear through them eastwards until you reach a small
          pool of lava. <em>(27,26)</em>
          <p>
            The pool of lava might look too crowded, but actually you can get
            solo pulls if you know the trick. Out of the 6 mobs at this lava
            pool, 3 of them are <span className="npc">Twilight Idolaters</span>,
            and they don't assist if you pull a mob that is next to them, they
            are busy performing a ritual. They will only attack if you attack
            them directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              So first you must pull the mobs one by one and then the idolaters
            </em>
            . Once you go the lava pool cleared, you can go get the quest from
            that captured elf, <span className="npc">Zameal Lunthistle</span>.
            After taking his quest, talk to him again and go through his
            dialogue, then turn in the quest and get the follow up:{' '}
            <span className="quest">[50] Prayer to Elune</span>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now all that is left for you to do is kill{' '}
          <strong>Twilight mobs</strong> (any of them) until you get :
          <ul>
            <li>
              <TtLink id="10552">Symbol of Ragnaros</TtLink>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        When you got both these items, you can say goodbye to your group and go
        back to Kalaran Windblade. You can also go to thorium point for a quick
        sell/repair if necessary.
        <li>
          Turn in your quest at Kalaran Windblade and get the follow up{' '}
          <span className="quest">[50] The Torh of Retribution</span>. Turn it
          in, watch him craft the torch, then get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[50] The Torch of Retribution</span>. Right
          click the stick surrounded by a green aura, complete the quest. Talk
          to Kalaran again, get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[50] Squire Maltrake.</span>
          <p>
            Turn in the quest at Squire Maltrake and get the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">[52] Set Them Ablaze! (Elite)</span>
          </p>
          <p>Luckily, this is one of the elite quests you can solo!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest to the first watch tower <em>(33,52)</em>. Don't forget
          to kill any mob you might still need on the way (golem, spider, dark
          iron steamsmith or lookout)
          <p>
            When you are at the 1st watch tower, clear any mobs guarding it
            (minus the elite inside of it), then search the{' '}
            <TtLink id="10515">Torch of Retribution</TtLink> in your inventory,
            equip it, and put it on a hotkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one elite Dark Iron Sentry on the tower, you don't need to
            kill it, just run past it (or stealth past it if you are
            rogue/druid). If you can iceroot / sheep / fear it, do so, but you
            don't have to. Just ignore it, quickly search for a small bowl on
            the floor named{' '}

              Sentry Brazier

            It will be instantly lit. Then jump down and run away to lose aggro
            on the elite.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do exactly the same thing on the 2nd tower <em>(35,59)</em>, the 3rd
            tower <em>(43,63)</em> and the 4th tower accessible only through a
            bridge at <em>(52,57)</em>.
            <br />
            <em>Note:</em>
            <br /> The 4th tower is the one with the most Dark Iron Lookouts, in
            case you didn't get a <TtLink id="18960">Lookout's Spyglass</TtLink>

          Dirt Piles and loot the <TtLink id="11018">Un'goro soil</TtLink> from
          them. Un'goro soil also drops fairly often from most creatures in
          Un'goro crater, you should try to have <strong>at least</strong> about
          50 Ungoro Soil before we leave Un'goro, because we will need extra
          soils for 2 other quests which will require you to transmuate Un'goro
