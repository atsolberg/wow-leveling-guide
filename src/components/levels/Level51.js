        <li>
          Sell and repair, then go south to the big dwarven forge/wheel{' '}
          <em>(39,50)</em> and kill <Npc id="">Dark Iron Steamsmiths</Npc>{' '}
          again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west and then south, basically staying close to the cauldron
          but never going down in it. Kill every <strong>dwarf</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>golem</strong> on your way. Basically make circles around the
          cauldron. Also make sure you kill any{' '}
          <Npc id="">Greater Lava Spider</Npc> on sight.
          <p>
            There is alot of them in an area west of the cauldron{' '}
            <em>(28,47)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While doing circles around the cauldron, make sure you kill the{' '}
            <Npc id="">Dark Iron Lookouts</Npc> you can find at the feet of each
            of the 4 watch towers. They drop the spyglass you need for one of
            the quests.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyway, as soon as you got 8{' '}
          <Item id="10551">Thorium Plated Daggers</Item>, go back to Kalaran
          Windblade, even if you didn't finish the other quests yet.
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> The <Item id="10551">Thorium Plated Daggers</Item>{' '}
            can drop on any dark iron dwarf, it generally takes me a full turn
            around the cauldron to get 8 of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn in the quest at Kalaran Windblade and get the follow up{' '}
            <Quest id="3452">[50] The Flame's Casing (Elite)</Quest>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go kill the 5 <Npc id="">Dark Iron Steamsmiths</Npc> again before you
          go, if you haven't got the Smithing Tuyere yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now you should ask in Looking for Group channel if anyone is
          interested in doing{' '}
          <Quest id="3452">[50] The Flame's Casing (Elite)</Quest> and{' '}
          <Quest id="3377">[50] Prayer to Elune (Elite)</Quest> (we are gonna
          get this quest on the way soon).
          <p>
            You can duo these two quests but it might be a bit tough depending
            on the class mix you get. So if you find more it's even better.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't find people to help you immediatly, just keep on doing
            circles around the cauldron killing dwarves, giants and greater lava
            spiders while waiting on people to join your group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you got yourself a group (or at least one level 48+ partner). Go
          west to the Twilight camp at <em>(24,34)</em>. There is a cavern with{' '}
          <strong>Twilight mobs</strong> further to the west but don't go there,
          first you should go up a narrow path up the mountain. When you are up
          the path, you should face your first twilight mobs, they are all elite
          and lvl 48-50. Clear through them eastwards until you reach a small
          pool of lava. <em>(27,26)</em>
          <p>
            The pool of lava might look too crowded, but actually you can get
            solo pulls if you know the trick. Out of the 6 mobs at this lava
            pool, 3 of them are <Npc id="">Twilight Idolaters</Npc>, and they
            don't assist if you pull a mob that is next to them, they are busy
            performing a ritual. They will only attack if you attack them
            directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              So first you must pull the mobs one by one and then the idolaters
            </em>
            . Once you go the lava pool cleared, you can go get the quest from
            that captured elf, <Npc id="">Zameal Lunthistle</Npc>. After taking
            his quest, talk to him again and go through his dialogue, then turn
            in the quest and get the follow up:{' '}
            <Quest id="3378">[50] Prayer to Elune</Quest>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now all that is left for you to do is kill{' '}
          <strong>Twilight mobs</strong> (any of them) until you get :
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Item id="10552">Symbol of Ragnaros</Item>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Item id="10458">Prayer to Elune</Item>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        When you got both these items, you can say goodbye to your group and go
        back to Kalaran Windblade. You can also go to thorium point for a quick
        sell/repair if necessary.
        <li>
          Turn in your quest at Kalaran Windblade and get the follow up{' '}
          <Quest id="3453">[50] The Torch of Retribution</Quest>. Turn it in,
          watch him craft the torch, then get the quest{' '}
          <Quest id="3454">[50] The Torch of Retribution</Quest>. Right click
          the stick surrounded by a green aura, complete the quest. Talk to
          Kalaran again, get the quest{' '}
          <Quest id="3462">[50] Squire Maltrake.</Quest>
          <p>
            Turn in the quest at Squire Maltrake and get the follow up{' '}
            <Quest id="3463">[52] Set Them Ablaze! (Elite)</Quest>
          </p>
          <p>Luckily, this is one of the elite quests you can solo!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest to the first watch tower <em>(33,52)</em>. Don't forget
          to kill any mob you might still need on the way (golem, spider, dark
          iron steamsmith or lookout)
          <p>
            When you are at the 1st watch tower, clear any mobs guarding it
            (minus the elite inside of it), then search the{' '}
            <Item id="10515">Torch of Retribution</Item> in your inventory,
            equip it, and put it on a hotkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one elite Dark Iron Sentry on the tower, you don't need to
            kill it, just run past it (or stealth past it if you are
            rogue/druid). If you can iceroot / sheep / fear it, do so, but you
            don't have to. Just ignore it, quickly search for a small bowl on
            the floor named <Object id="149025">Sentry Brazier</Object> and
            right click it.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            It will be instantly lit. Then jump down and run away to lose aggro
            on the elite.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do exactly the same thing on the 2nd tower <em>(35,59)</em>, the 3rd
            tower <em>(43,63)</em> and the 4th tower accessible only through a
            bridge at <em>(52,57)</em>.
            <br />
            <em>Note:</em>
            <br /> The 4th tower is the one with the most Dark Iron Lookouts, in
            case you didn't get a <Item id="18960">Lookout's Spyglass</Item>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          After you are done setting the 4th tower ablaze, go east to the

            go south and find a narrow path going up the mountain at{' '}

            as mage, warrior and rogue, I just used long cooldown abilities and
            didn't even need to use potions. He wanders from this path in the

          Go back to Squire Maltrake <em>(38,39)</em>, turn in the quest and
          watch Kalaran transform into a dragon, make his speech and then he'll
          fly away. Righ tclick the treasure chest named{' '}

          Now there's only one thing left for you to do: finish all the quests
          that you haven't finished yet, and you already should know where all

          Red, Blue, Yellow and Green crystals. Loot them anytime you see them

          Dirt Piles and loot the <Item id="11018">Un'goro soil</Item> from
          them. Un'goro soil also drops fairly often from most creatures in
          Un'goro crater, you should try to have <strong>at least</strong> about
          50 Ungoro Soil before we leave Un'goro, because we will need extra
