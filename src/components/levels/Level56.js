          Go back to Jaedenar into the Shadow Hold. Clear inside the hold
          further than when you doused the last 2 flames, past the red pool.
          Just a bit further down a slope you should find a room with an altar
          in it's middle,{' '}
          <span className="strong">4 warlocks/darkweavers arouned it</span>,
          channeling a ritual, and <span className="strong">Rakaiah</span>{' '}
          infront.
          <p>
            You can pull Rakaiah solo, the 4 warlocks will be aggro on you but
            won't attack as long as you don't directly attack them. After you
            got rid of Rakaiah, you will still be locked in combat mode because
            of the 4 warlocks, to lose combat mode you just have to run back
            some distance away from them until they forget you. Basically they
            never attack you unless you directly attack them. However the
            warlock's imp pets will attack you and you should dispose of them.{' '}
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Kill the 2 other mobs on each side of the room and the one in the
          back, then you can kill each of the 4 warlocks one by one. When the
          room is clear, click on the Remains of{' '}
          <span className="strong">Trey Lightforge</span> on the altar, choose
          your reward and complete the quest{' '}

        </li>
        <li>
          Go past the Altar Room and down a spiral, after a couple of pulls
          you'll be facing a small bridge going up straight ahead and a slope
          going down to your left.
          <p>
            Go left and keep going in that direction until you reach a big room

            succubus guards.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't an easy fight to solo, I basically used everything I had
            with the mage and rogue. I sheeped Shadow Lord Fel'dan and killed
            the two succubus fast. Same with rogue, I sapped the shadow lord and
            killed it last. With the warrior I used retaliation. Don't forget to
            loot the <span className="item">head of the Shadow Lord.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This part of the dungeon is just much easier with a group, you can
            try it solo but I recommend at least finding a person to duo it
            with.

          the crater before you start the escort. Let him be infront and get hit
          first or he won't assist. The good thing is that he is quite a tank so
          you can let him tank a bit when there is multiple mobs. He will get
          back on the road after having done a full circle around the pool,{' '}
