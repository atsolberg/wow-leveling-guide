            These quests are repeatable but only the first turn ins give XP. On

            Go back to Jaedenar into the Shadow Hold. Clear inside the hold
            further than when you doused the last 2 flames, past the red pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just a bit further down a slope you should find a room with an altar
            in it's middle, 4 <Npc id="">warlocks</Npc>/
            <Npc id="">darkweavers</Npc> arouned it, channeling a ritual, and{' '}
            <Npc id="">Rakaiah</Npc> infront.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can pull Rakaiah solo, the 4 warlocks will be aggro on you but
            won't attack as long as you don't directly attack them. After you
            got rid of Rakaiah, you will still be locked in combat mode because
            of the 4 warlocks, to lose combat mode you just have to run back
            some distance away from them until they forget you.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically they never attack you unless you directly attack them.
            However the warlock's imp pets will attack you and you should
            dispose of them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Kill the 2 other mobs on each side of the room and the one in the
            back, then you can kill each of the 4 warlocks one by one. When the
            room is clear, click on the Remains of{' '}
            <Npc id="">Trey Lightforge</Npc> on the altar, choose your reward
            and complete the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="5204">[57] Retribution of the Light</Quest>, get the
            follow up{' '}
            <Quest id="5385">|57] The Remains of Trey Lightforge.</Quest>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go past the Altar Room and down a spiral, after a couple of pulls
            you'll be facing a small bridge going up straight ahead and a slope
            going down to your left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go left and keep going in that direction until you reach a big room
            where you'll find <Npc id="">Shadow Lord Fel'dan</Npc> and his two
            succubus guards.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't an easy fight to solo, I basically used everything I had
            with the mage and rogue. I sheeped{' '}
            <Npc id="">Shadow Lord Fel'dan</Npc> and killed the two succubus
            fast. Same with rogue, I sapped the shadow lord and killed it last.
            With the warrior I used retaliation. Don't forget to loot the{' '}
            <Item id="13207">Shadow Lord Fel'dan's Head</Item>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This part of the dungeon is just much easier with a group, you can
            try it solo but I recommend at least finding a person to duo it
            with.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Clear your way out of the Shadow Hold and out of Jaedenar, get back
            on the road and ride north until Irontree Woods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to the crater at <em>(49,27)</em>, you'll find plenty of{' '}
            <Npc id="">Toxic Horrors</Npc> there, kill them until you got 3{' '}
            <Item id="12822">Toxic Horror Droplet</Item>. There's more Toxic
            Horrors all around the big green pool just north of the crater.

        <li>
          <p>
            In Irontree woods go to the ruins at <em>(49,30)</em> and click the{' '}
            <Item id="11445">Flute of the Ancients</Item> from your inventory.
            some treant spirits will appear, especially one huge treant named{' '}
            <Npc id="">Arei</Npc>. If he's not there, it means someone else is
            already escorting him. Go kill some{' '}
            <span className="strong">treants and elementals</span> while
            waiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get his quest <Quest id="4261">[56] Ancient Spirit</Quest>{' '}
            <em>and escort Arei</em>. He will do a full turn around the green
            pool, so I suggest you clear the toxic horrors around the crater
            before you start the escort. Let him be infront and get hit first or
            he won't assist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good thing is that he is quite a tank so you can let him tank a
            bit when there is multiple mobs. He will get back on the road after
            having done a full circle around the pool,{' '}
            <span className="strong">3 irontrees will ambush him</span> at this
            point. Kill them fast one by one while Arei tanks the others. You
            will get a quest complete message normally.

            When you find the 3 <Npc id="">Winterfall runners</Npc> (lvl 57),
            you don't have to kill all 3. Just kill one fast and run away, come
