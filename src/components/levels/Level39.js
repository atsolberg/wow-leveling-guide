        <span className="quest">[42] Study of the Elements: Rock</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be getting close to level 40 at this point, about 35000 xp to
        go normally, if you still follow the &quot;kill everything on your
        way&quot; rule. Go grind on Rock Elementals or Lesser Rock Elementals,
        Dark Dwarves or Troggs. There are a lot of Dwarves at the Angor
        Fortress. It&apos;s up to you. Should take about 1h30 of grinding.
      </p>
      <p>
        It went quite well for me, I was doing 41000 XP/Hour before I got to the
        grinding part. This is my XP rate starting from the moment I talked to
        Prospector Ryedoll until level 40.

      </p>
      <p>
        So that&apos;s approximately 1 level and a half in 4 Hours. If you can
        do better, I would love to know!{' '}
