        <p>
          There's a weapon merchant, use it to repair and sell junk. You can
          also destroy the extra power crystals if you still have any, for more
          bagspace.
        </p>

        <li>
          Get out of Marshall's Refuge and ride east along the wall until{' '}
          <em>(54,13)</em>. At this spot go up the mountain and you should find
          the Northern Crystal Pylon. Click it, and examine it, you should get a
          "quest complete" message. Further north of the crystal you should find
          some <Npc id="">Pterrordax</Npc> (3 of them normally), kill them.
          <p>From this point on, kill the following mobs on sight:</p>
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>

        <p>
          And also beware of the <Npc id="">Tyrant Devilsaurs</Npc>, there is a
          few of them roaming in Un'Goro. They are lvl 55ish elite, run fast and
          hit hard. So watch your back.
        </p>

        <li>
          Go east to Fungal Rock. You should find plenty of{' '}
          <Npc id="">apes</Npc> there outside and inside the cave.
          <p>
            Kill apes there until you get 2 un'goro{' '}

            <Item id="11480">thunderer</Item> pelts . Inside the ape cave at the
            first fork go right until you find <Npc id="">A-Me 01</Npc>, turn in
            the quest but don't get the follow up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be careful when fighting the <Npc id="">Un'Goro Gorillas</Npc>, they
            call for help when they get low health, and any other ape in a
            rather wide range will come to help. So, fight them away from other
            apes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go south until you find 3 black pools with{' '}
          <Npc id="">Tar Creepers</Npc> and <Npc id="">Tar Beasts</Npc> around
          them <em>(60,26)</em>. Clear these 3 pools until you have 12{' '}

          kill)
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southeast until the expedition encampment <em>(68,36)</em> and loot
          the Crate of Foodstuffs.
          <p>
            Go southeast until you find the Eastern Crystal Pylon{' '}
            <em>(76,48)</em>. Click it and examine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go south to <Npc id="">Torwa Pathfinder</Npc> <em>(71,75)</em> and
            turn in <Quest id="4289">[55] The Apes of Un'Goro</Quest>, don't get
            the follow up.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go west to the Slithering Scar and clear yourself a path to the bug
          lair entrance at <em>(50,76)</em>. Inside the bug lair at the first
          fork go left, clear the circular room and then stand in the middle of
          it, look in your inventory for a black vial named "Scraping Vial" and
          click it. If it doesn't work try different spots in this room until
          you get a <Item id="11131">Hive Wall Sample</Item>.
          <p>
            At this point you might already have gotten a{' '}
            <Item id="11837">Gorishi Scent Gland</Item>. If you didn't, keep on
            killing these bugs until one drops. It can drop from any of the
            bugs, inside or outside the lair, it doesn't matter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go directly south of the bug lair and up the mountain <em>(50,88)</em>
          . You should find <Npc id="">2 Pterrordax</Npc> there, kill them.
          <p>
            A bit further to the west you should find another of those spots up
            the mountains with 4 or 5 Pterrordax there <em>(44,87)</em>, kill
            them. Stay at this spot until you get your 10 Pterrodax kills, you
            can kill some bugs while waiting on respawns.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Then get on your mount and ride to the expedition camp at{' '}
          <em>(38,66)</em>, try to avoid the aggros as much as possible because
          most mobs are too tough for you here. At the expedition camp, look for
          a pile of crates named <Item id="11112">"Research Equipment"</Item>{' '}
          and loot them. Then go northwest, run away from any aggro if you have
          to, the lake is pretty safe so I suggest you just swim through it,
          going northwest until you reach the big rock on the other bank. Behind
          this rock you 'll find a little goblin named Krakle, get his quest
          quickly <Quest id="974">[55] Finding the Source</Quest>, quickly
          because a Devilsaur roams at this place every now and then.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go directly west and a bit to the south and you will find the{' '}
          <strong>western crystal pylon</strong>
          <em>(23,57)</em>. Click it and examine it.
          <p>Ride northeast back to Marshall's Refuge and sell and repair.</p>
          <p>
            If you haven't finished{' '}
            <Quest id="4141">[52] Muigin and Larion</Quest>, go out and kill
            some more flowers until you complete it. Go to the area which is
            southeast of the black pools where we killed the Tar beasts. There
            are plenty there and they are the easiest flowers to kill{' '}
            <em>(65,27)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also make a stop at the <strong>Northern Crystal Pylon</strong>
            <em>(55,13)</em> and kill the 2 <Npc id="">Pterrordax</Npc> there,
            you should have your 10 Pterrordax kills then.

          Then go back to Marshall's Refuge and turn in:

              crystals at the various pylons for some consumable crystals with

        <p>
          Get out of the cave and get the quest from Linken{' '}

        </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Get on your mount and ride west along the mountain until you reach
            two stone pillars <em>(29,22)</em>. From there, follow the path
            going up the mountain until you zone into Silithus, keep going west
            on the road until you reach Cenarion Hold. In Cenarion Hold find the
            Hippogryph Master, he's at the feet of the highest tower. Fly to
            Gadgetzan.
          </p>

            Hearthstone to Darnassus, go to the Cenarion Enclave, behind the

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>This time no xp bonus at all, and the XP from
            turning in [50] Un'goro Soil is missing, because I went LD before
            using hearthstone, and managed to take the screenshot quick. So
            that's actually 41000 XP/ Hour, not too shabby!
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to the top of the Cenarion tower and get the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="3785">[50] Morrowgrain Research</Quest> from{' '}
            <Npc id="">Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm</Npc>. A floor below get the

          <p>
            Search your inventory for something named{' '}
            <Item id="11020">Evergreen Pouch</Item>. From now on, click it
            everytime the timer is ready, it will create an{' '}
            <Item id="11024">Evergreen herb casing</Item>, open it and loot
            what's inside. It can be various herbs but sometimes it will be{' '}
            <Item id="11040">Morrowgrain</Item>, and that's what you need. You
            need 2 <Item id="11018">Ungoro Soil</Item> everytime you want to use
            the pouch, but you should still have about 20 left even after
            turning the quests.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need a total of 20 <Item id="11040">Morrowgrain</Item>,
            which you might not get if you are unlucky with the evergreen pouch,
            however you will probably get 10 Morrowgrain at least, and that's
            what you'll need in short term, the other 10 morrowgrains are not so
            urgent, and we'll go back to Un'goro if you run out of Un'goro soils
            anyway. However once you got 20 Morrowgrain you can stop using the
            evergreen pouch. I personally sold the seeds and the un'goro soil I
            had left after obtained my 20 morrowgrain, and also destroyed the
            evergreen pouch, because I like having bag space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't stand still and do nothing while waiting on the pouch timer
            though, go on with the next part of the guide! You can click on the
            evergreen pouch every now and then everytime the cooldown is
            refreshed, until you get 20 <Item id="11040">Morrowgrain</Item>.

        <li>
          Go back to Talrendis Point and turn in the two quests. Then get back
          on the road and ride northeast. Go around the ruins of Eldarath by the
          west side of it and keep going northeast. Avoid the{' '}
          <Npc id="">Timbermaw Furlbogs</Npc>, don't kill any of them even if
          they attack you, just run away. Avoid the other timbermaw camp{' '}
          <strong>Ursolan</strong>, go around it by the east side and keep
          riding northeast until you get to sharp hill at <em>(53,21)</em>, get
          to the top of it, you can only access it from the north. Up top you'll
          find a goblin named <Npc id="">Kim'jael</Npc>. Get his quest{' '}

          Base Camp <em>(55,26)</em>. Start killing <strong>Blood Elves</strong>
          , a lot of blood elves. This is a good grinding spot, rarely occupied.
          The elves have low hit points and can drop runecloth, and they respawn
          fast!
          <br />
          For those who aren't already level 53, I suggest you grind until you
          are level 53 and 4 bubbles of exp in (approximately 25000 XP). Read
          the Next paragraph though while you grind on those elves.
