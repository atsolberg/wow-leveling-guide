          of the crystal you should find some{' '}

        </p>

        <li>
          Go east to Fungal Rock. You should find plenty of{' '}

          <p>
            Be careful when fighting the Un'Goro Gorillas, they call for help
            when they get low health, and any other ape in a rather wide range
            will come to help. So, fight them away from other apes.

        </li>
        <li>
          Go west to the Slithering Scar and clear yourself a path to the bug
          lair entrance at <span className="em">(50,76)</span>. Inside the bug
          lair at the first fork go left, clear the circular room and then stand
          in the middle of it, look in your inventory for a black vial named
          &quot;Scraping Vial&quot; and click it. If it doesn't work try
          different spots in this room until you get a{' '}
          <span className="item">Hive Wall Sample</span>.
          <p>
            At this point you might already have gotten a{' '}

            keep on killing these bugs until one drops. It can drop from any of
            the bugs, inside or outside the lair, it doesn't matter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go directly south of the bug lair and up the mountain{' '}
          <span className="em">(50,88)</span>. You should find{' '}
          <span className="strong">2 Pterrordax</span> there, kill them.
          <p>
            A bit further to the west you should find another of those spots up
            the mountains with 4 or 5 Pterrordax there{' '}
            <span className="em">(44,87)</span>, kill them. Stay at this spot
            until you get your 10 Pterrodax kills, you can kill some bugs while
            waiting on respawns.

        <li>
          Then get on your mount and ride to the expedition camp at{' '}

          as possible because most mobs are too tough for you here. At the
          expedition camp, look for a pile of crates named{' '}
          <span className="strong">&quot;Research Equipment&quot;</span> and
          loot them. Then go northwest, run away from any aggro if you have to,
          the lake is pretty safe so I suggest you just swim through it, going
          northwest until you reach the big rock on the other bank. Behind this
          rock you 'll find a little goblin named Krakle, get his quest quickly{' '}

            area which is southeast of the black pools where we killed the Tar

            &quot;Evergreen herb casing&quot;, open it and loot what's inside.
            It can be various herbs but sometimes it will be{' '}
            <span className="item">Morrowgrain</span>, and that's what you need.
            You need <span className="item">2 Ungoro Soil</span> everytime you

            You will need a total of 20 Morrowgrain, which you might not get if
            you are unlucky with the evergreen pouch, however you will probably
            get 10 Morrowgrain at least, and that's what you'll need in short
            term, the other 10 morrowgrains are not so urgent, and we'll go back
            to Un'goro if you run out of Un'goro soils anyway. However once you
            got 20 Morrowgrain you can stop using the evergreen pouch. I
            personally sold the seeds and the un'goro soil I had left after
            obtained my 20 morrowgrain, and also destroyed the evergreen pouch,

          <p>
            Then keep going east following the road until you zone into Azshara{' '}
            <span className="em">(92,46)</span>, it's a long ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right after entering Azshara you'll find Talrendis Point to the

            Go north on the other side of the road to Shadowsong Shrine{' '}
            <span className="em">(13,74)</span>. Kill{' '}
            <span className="strong">6 Highborne Apparitions</span> and{' '}

          Go back to Talrendis Point and turn in the two quests. Then get back
          on the road and ride northeast. Go around the ruins of Eldarath by the
          west side of it and keep going northeast. Avoid the Timbermaw
          Furlbogs, don't kill any of them even if they attack you, just run
          away. Avoid the other timbermaw camp &quot;ursolan&quot;, go around it
          by the east side and keep riding northeast until you get to sharp hill
          at <span className="em">(53,21)</span>, get to the top of it, you can
          only access it from the north. Uptop you'll find a goblin named
          Kim'jael. Get his quest{' '}

        <li>
          Just southeast of Kim'jael you'll find Thalassian Base Camp{' '}
          <span className="em">(55,26)</span>. Start killing{' '}
          <span className="strong">Blood Elves</span>, a lot of blood elves.
          This is a good grinding spot, rarely occupied. The elves have low hit
          points and can drop runecloth, and they respawn fast!
          <br />
          For those who aren't already level 53, I suggest you grind until you
          are level 53 and 4 bubbles of exp in (approximately 25000 XP). Read
          the Next paragraph though while you grind on those elves.
