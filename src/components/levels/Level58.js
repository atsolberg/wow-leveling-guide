            Get full hp/mana, get next to one of them and click your{' '}

            horn).{' '}

              1 to 3 lvl 57 worms will spawn and attack you

            . When it's 3 it might be tough to handle solo, so always start
            those fights with full hp and if possible potions / long cooldown
            abilities up. Back off from the silos after you summon the worms, if
            you stay too close more worms will spawn sometimes, and that's
            probably more than you can handle solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The worms only appear when the silo is sparkling blue. They take a
            while to sparkle again after you use the temporal displacer next to
            them. There's 3 more silos just a bit more to the east.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep doing that until you have{' '}

            Now what you have to do is go from destroyed house to destroyed
            house in Andorhal and look for Small Lockboxes like this:

          </p>
          <p>
            Loot the Andorhal Watch from it. Keep doing this until you have{' '}
            <span className="item">5 Andorhal Watches.</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the town hall (with a tower clock) which is in the middle of
          Andorhal, close to where Araj the Summoner is, you can sneak in the
          town hall without having to fight any of the bunch of mobs close to
          it.
          <p>
            Inside the town hall you'll find several{' '}
            <span className="strong">&quot;Musty Tome&quot;</span> lying on the
            floor. When you click one, there is a chance you will find the{' '}
            <span className="item">Annals of Darrowshire</span>, but there is a
            higher chance that you will get a{' '}
            <span className="item">&quot;Ruined Tome&quot;</span> and 1 or 2
            level 57 mobs will attack you. They give no loot and no exp.
            Hoewever there is a trick to know which tome is the right one.{' '}
            <span className="strong">
              There is a slight graphical difference
            </span>
            . The pages of the fake tomes have two-tone colored pages,
            lightbrown and white, like this one:{' '}

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The good tome looks &quot;newer&quot;, and it's pages only have one
            color tone, like this one:{' '}

          <p>
            You can easily see the difference if you zoom in 1st person view and
            put your mouse pointer over the books to highlight them. Loot the{' '}

          Ride to Eastern Plaguelands and go southeast to the Undercroft, which
          is directly south of the Marris Stead.

          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the crypt in the Undercroft you'll find{' '}
            <span className="strong">Tiron Fordring's Grave</span>{' '}
            <span className="em">(28,86)</span>. Next to should be a{' '}
            <span className="strong">&quot;Loose Dirt Mound&quot;</span>. This
            is where you need help, this almost impossible to do solo unless you
            use a lot of creativy and everything you got. Anyway here is what
            happens when you click the dirt mount,{' '}
            <span className="strong">Mercutio Filthgorger</span> and{' '}
            <span className="strong">3 Dwarf Graverobbers</span> spawn and go to
            the dirt mound, if you are close they of course jump you.
            <br />
            They all hit hard, especially Mercutio, and all have a lot of hit
            points for non elites. Here is what I suggest:
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as you click the dirt mount, run to the other side of the
            fence, you can jump over it if you walk up the mountain a bit. The 4
            dwarves will walk to the grave and stand there.

          <p>
            <span className="em">You have two ways to do this now:</span>

            kill Mercutio, loot his hammer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="strong">2.</span> Ignore the 3 adds and go all out
            on Mercurio, loot the hammer and run.

            <span className="em">
              Use creativity with the classes you have!

          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="strong">Ex:</span> With my rogue I got help from a
            warrior. He charged Mercutio and used intimidating shout as soon as
            possible to send the 3 gravediggers away for 10 sec or so. We both
            went all out on Mercutio, looted and ran away. Anyway, if you don't
            get help immediatly, there's something to do in the Undercroft while
            you look for help:
          </p>
          <p>
            Go inside the crypt <span className="em">(27,85)</span>, clear the
            way down, kill <span className="strong">Zaeldarr the Outcast</span>{' '}
            and <span className="em">loot his head</span>.<br />
            In the same room look for a{' '}
            <span className="strong">&quot;Torn Scroll&quot;</span> on the

            , grind on the trolls in the Undercroft while waiting for someone to
