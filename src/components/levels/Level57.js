            <Npc id="9376">Blazerunner</Npc> is a lvl 56 Elite fire elemental
            and he hits for 400. So just save this quest for when you are level
            60 and have time to spend on that quest, the rewards aren't that
            great, we did it for XP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway here is how to defeat <Npc id="9376">Blazerunner</Npc>, the
            last boss of the long quest chain "Linken's Adventure". Go to the
            top of fire plume ridge, clear all the <strong>elementals</strong>{' '}
            around to make sure they don't add during the fight.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Equip the <Item id="11522">Silver Totem of Aquementas</Item> and put
            it on a hotkey. Click it to dispel{' '}
            <strong>Blazerunner's aura</strong> right at the start and everytime
            it reappears.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Blazerunner is somewhat invincible when his aura is on, he keeps
            knockbacking people and every damage he takes is divided by 10.{' '}
            <strong>So be sure to always keep that aura dispelled</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing, fight him inside his cave with your back facing the
            walls, so if he knockbacks you when the aura appears again you won't
            end up being tossed off the mountain or into adds.
          </p>
          <p>
            He's a tough fight, I did it with a level 57 Priest, a level 55
            Paladin and me (lvl 57 rogue) and it wasn't easy. On the other hand
            I soloed it with my lvl 57 frost mage, thanks to kiting, it took
            time and several attempts though. So I recommend saving that quest
            for when you are level 60 and have time to spend on it, unless you
            got enough people to help you immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway if you do manage to kill Blazerunner, you must also go loot
            the <Object id="164910">Ornate Chest</Object> in his cave. Then turn
            in the quest at <Npc id="">Linken</Npc>.

            Hearthstone to Gadgetzan, fly to Theramore, take the boat to

          </p>
          <p>
            From now on try to find a partner or more to do the quest{' '}
            <Quest id="4182">[54] Dragonkin Menace (Elite)</Quest>, some of the
            dragons will most likely be too hard for you to solo, so ask for
            help (Hunters, Warlocks and frost mages will probably be able to
            solo them though).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't find help immediatly for it, proceed with the next
            steps of the guide while actively looking for people to help you
            with the dragons. When you find someone, go to the paragraph called{' '}
            <strong>"Dragonkin Menace"</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go south to the Ruins of Thaurissan and kill mobs there while
            looking around for <strong>"Thaurissan Relics"</strong>. They are
            grey stones looking like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="/assets/wp/thaurissanrelic.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            While gathering relics go towards the western end of the Ruins of
            Thaurissan, you'll find a Dwarven Statue at <em>(53,40)</em> and the{' '}
            <strong>Tablet of the Seven</strong> at its feet. Click it and{' '}
            <em>"Transcribe the tablet"</em>. You'll receive a{' '}
            <Item id="11470">Tablet Transcript</Item>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once you have 12 <Item id="11470">Tablet Transcripts</Item>, go west
            to the Blackrock Stronghold <em>(44,35)</em>. Kill{' '}
            <strong>Orcs</strong> there unil you have 50{' '}
            <Item id="11467">Blackrock Medallions</Item>. If the place is too
            crowded (it often is), go south to the area named "The Pillar of
            Ash", there's more Blackrock Orcs there.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go east to Dreadmaul Rock <em>(73,48)</em>. Kill what's on the kill
            list of <Quest id="3823">[52] Extinguish the Firegut</Quest>. You
            can find these <strong>ogres</strong> all around Dreadmaul Rock, I
            recommend fighting on the eastern side though so you avoid dragonkin
            adds.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point if you still haven't found someone to help you, grind
            on Orcs at the Blackrock Stronghold or PIllar of Ash. Ask your guild
            for help or your friends, but get someone to help you for{' '}
            <Quest id="4182">[54] Dragonkin Menace</Quest>.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Dragonkin Menace </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            When you find a partner to duo the dragonkins with, go to the area
            which is north of Dreadmaul Rock <em>(78,28)</em>, you should find{' '}
            <Npc id="">Black Broodlings</Npc> there. Search your inventory for{' '}
            <Item id="12284">Draco-Incarcinatrix 900</Item> and put it on a
            hotkey. Use it on every Black Broodling before killing them.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            When they die while having the incarcinatrix aura on, a crystal will
            appear at their corpse named <strong>"Broodling Essence"</strong>.
            You need 8 of these.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make a semi circle around the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock, that's
            where you'll find the dragonkins you need. Complete the kill list of{' '}
            <Quest id="4182">[54] Dragonkin Menace</Quest> while getting the 8{' '}
            <Item id="12283">Broodling Essence</Item> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you leave this area go to the northeastern edge of it, you'll
            find a cave with Cyrus Therepentous in it.
