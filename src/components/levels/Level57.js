          a few people to help you. Get at least a healer and a tank type.
          Blazerunner is a lvl 56 Elite fire elemental and he hits for 400. So
          just save this quest for when you are level 60 and have time to spend
          on that quest, the rewards aren't that great, we did it for XP.
          <p>
            Anyway here is how to defeat{' '}
            <span className="strong">Blazerunner</span>, the last boss of the
            long quest chain &quot;Linken's Adventure&quot;. Go to the top of
            fire plume ridge, clear all the{' '}
            <span className="strong">elementals</span> around to make sure they
            don't add during the fight. Equip the{' '}
            <span className="item">Silver Totem of Aquementas</span> and put it
            on a hotkey. Click it to dispel{' '}
            <span className="strong">Blazerunner's aura</span> right at the
            start and everytime it reappears. Blazerunner is somewhat invincible
            when his aura is on, he keeps knockbacking people and every damage
            he takes is divided by 10.{' '}
            <span className="strong">
              So be sure to always keep that aura dispelled
            </span>
            . <br />
            Another thing, fight him inside his cave with your back facing the
            walls, so if he knockbacks you when the aura appears again you won't
            end up being tossed off the mountain or into adds.
            <br />
            He's a tough fight, I did it with a level 57 Priest, a level 55
            Paladin and me (lvl 57 rogue) and it wasn't easy. On the other hand
            I soloed it with my lvl 57 frost mage, thanks to kiting, it took
            time and several attempts though. So I recommend saving that quest
            for when you are level 60 and have time to spend on it, unless you
            got enough people to help you immediately. Anyway if you do manage
            to kill Blazerunner, you must also go loot the{' '}
            <span className="strong">Ornate Chest</span> in his cave. Then turn
            in the quest at Linken.

            , some of the dragons will most likely be too hard for you to solo,
            so ask for help (Hunters, Warlocks and frost mages will probably be
            able to solo them though). If you don't find help immediatly for it,
            proceed with the next steps of the guide while actively looking for
            people to help you with the dragons. When you find someone, go to

            At this point if you still haven't found someone to help you, grind

            need 8 of these.
