            <em>(49,37)</em>. Turn in the quest. Before you accept the rescue
            quest, here is what you must know:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This quest, unlike the Feralas one, is more likely to be done
              solo. It's still not a walk in the part of course. So if you got a
              partner to duo it, all the better for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the chicken run in front of you, let it get the first hit. If
              it's not getting hit, it won't fight back. Sometimes mobs are
              actually chasing the chicken and failing to get a hit on it, so
              they give up.
            </li>
            <li>
              You'll have to face 2 ambushes of 3 mobs each, make sure you are
              full health/mana and with long cooldown abilities up when you
              start the escort. When the 3 ambushers attack, stand back until
              the chicken gets hit. Then let the chicken tank one of the 3 adds,
              deal with the 2 others as quick as you can, then help the chicken
              finish off the 3rd add.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you don't have the beacon, you can come back later when you get
            one. But of course now is the most efficient time to do it, cause
            it's on your quest path{' '}
            <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
              ðŸ™‚
            </span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go southeast, to the <strong>Overlook Cliffs</strong>
            <em>(70,63)</em> and follow the path down to the shore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search your bags for the <TtLink id="9328">Super Snapper FX</TtLink>{' '}
            and make a hotkey out of it. Then ride along the shore and search
            for a named turtle named <Npc id="">Gammerita</Npc>.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is easy to discern from the rest because she's the only
            aggressive turtle (red name -- turn NPC names on in your interface
            options, advanced options tab). She roams a lot, so you'll find her
            anywhere between the waterfall <em>(82,47)</em> and Revantusk
            Village <em>(77,77)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't need to kill her, just get close enough and use the Super
            Snapper FX on her, she will not like it and will attack you, just
            run away. You should now normally have a{' '}
            <TtLink id="9330">Snapshot of Gammerita</TtLink> in your inventory.

        </li>

          <p>
            Hearthstone <strong>back to Aerie Peak</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn in the quests:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="quest">[45] Troll Necklace Bounty</span>
              </li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Optional:</em> You can turn in more Troll Necklaces at the same
            NPC if you have extra stacks of 5. You gain 390 XP and extra faction
            with these dwarves each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to the top floor of Aerie Peak to{' '}
            <Npc id="">Gryphon Master Talonaxe</Npc> and get the follow up:{' '}

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go to the <strong>Altar of Zul</strong> <em>(49,64)</em> and kill
            trolls / wolves there. Now the best would be that you shout in the
            "Looking for group" channel the following:{' '}
            <em>
              "Looking for more to do{' '}
              <span className="quest">[48] The Altar of Zul</span> and get the{' '}
              <TtLink id="9241">Sacred Mallet</TtLink>"
            </em>
            During peak times there's almost always people interested in doing
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, if you don't find people willing to do this immediately,
            just keep on killing trolls / wolves in this area (or the lower
            level ones to the west) until you get a group going.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also use the oportunity to finish the{' '}
            <TtLink id="10819">Wildkin Feather</TtLink> gathering. (You need 15
            feathers)
          </p>
          <p>
            You and two level 50s should be just enough to kill the 2 NPCs on
            top of the Altar of Zul. More will make it easier of course. I even
            managed to do it with just me (lvl 47 rogue) and a level 48 priest.
            But it was really close.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of the temple of Zul you'll find 2 level 50 elites.{' '}
            <Npc id="">Qiaga</Npc> and <Npc id="">Morta'gya</Npc>. With me
            playing my mage I managed to kill them with a level 51 Hunter and a
            50 Priest, I sheeped Morta and we killed Qiaga first. It went quite
            smooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loot the <TtLink id="9241">Sacred Mallet</TtLink> from Qiaga. Then
            walk on top of the altar in the middle of it and you'll get a quest
            update for <span className="quest">[48] The Altar of Zul.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              **Note: If you don't find a group to kill the 2 elites, nevermind.
