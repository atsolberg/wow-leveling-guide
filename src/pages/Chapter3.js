          the wow-pro team: a warrior, a mage, a rogue and a hunter to ensure

            Having a lot of bag space is really important. The higher you get in

            vendor. At level 60 when you will go farm money or anything, it will
            also be very handy to have a lot of bag space. Why only 3 traveller

            <p>
              Inside the slag pit go across the bridge, on your left will be the
              Quarry Gate, go through it.
              <br />
              Work your way northwards until a bigger room where you'll find{' '}
              <span className="strong">Enslaved Archeologists</span> and a big{' '}
              <span className="strong">52 Elite elite golem</span> lying down
              (ignore it). Go up the iron slope, midway on the slope you have 2
              options, straight or left. Go straight. You'll soon enter a room
              with several pairs of <span className="strong">taskmasters</span>{' '}
              and <span className="strong">slavers</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this room further in and to the right you'll find{' '}
              <span className="strong">Overseer Maltorius</span> and{' '}
              <span className="strong">2 Dark Iron Sentries</span>. These are 3
              elites so you can't solo them. You can either try to find more
              people (I managed to duo it with mage + paladin) or just abandon
              this quest. However, behind these 3 elites you can find{' '}
              <span className="item">Secret Plans: Fiery Flux</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You need to click the plan and not be interupted for 6 seconds. So
              how do you do this? Well several classes can't do it, Paladins for
              example. Some can, like mage:
            </p>
            <p>
              Sheep the overseer, let the 2 sentries come to you, Iceroot them,
              run for the scroll and loot it fast, then jump down the ledge
              behind the scroll.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or warlock, hunter: Send in the pet, quickly loot the scroll and
              jump down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or warrior: charge the Taskmaster, and use intimidating shout.
              Loot the scroll quickly and jump down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Engineers can probably make it too if they got a high level target
              dummy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, that's if you can't find people to kill those 3 elites
              with you, so try to find people for it and in the meantime you can
              go on with the other quests inside the Slag Pit. Better try it
              with 2 other people, its a tough fight because Overseer is a mage
              and casts polymorph. If you got paladin or priest they can dispell
              it. Best is to sap/sheep Overseer and kill the 2 sentries first,
              then deal with the overseer alone.
            </p>
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            From the same big room, go over the iron bridge which is on the
            opposite side of the 3 elites. On the other side of the bridge, jump
            down to the lower floor at the drop off spot indicated on the map.
            From this spot go east and you should find{' '}
            <span className="strong">Incendosaurs</span>, kill 20 of them.
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            When done with that, go back up the ramp and then get out of the
            Slag pit, jump down back into the Cauldron and work your way
            westwards looking for{' '}
            <span className="strong">Blaze Elementals</span> until you get{' '}

            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Then go to the iron slope you took previously at{' '}
            <span className="em">(46,53)</span> Follow this slope but this time
            skip the first entrance to the slag pit, and get on the elevator{' '}
            <span className="em">(40,54)</span>. The elevator will stop at the
            1st floor and 2nd floor but don't get off. Wait until it's on the
            3rd floor from there you can get out of the Cauldron.<p></p>
            <p>
              Kill every <span className="strong">Steamsmith</span> you find
              around the buildings infront and to the left of you after getting
              off the elevator <span className="em">(39,50)</span>. There is 5
              Steamsmiths at this spot, pray that one of them drops a smithing
              Tuyere. If not don't worry, we'll kill more of these later.

            <p>
              You can duo these two quests but it might be a bit tough depending
              on the class mix you get. So if you find more it's even better.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't find people to help you immediatly, just keep on
              doing circles around the cauldron killing dwarves, giants and

            Once you got yourself a group (or at least one level 48+ partner).
            Go west to the Twilight camp at <span className="em">(24,34)</span>.
            There is a cavern with <span className="strong">Twilight mobs</span>{' '}
            further to the west but don't go there, first you should go up a
            narrow path up the mountain. When you are up the path, you should
            face your first twilight mobs, they are all elite and lvl 48-50.
            Clear through them eastwards until you reach a small pool of lava.{' '}
            <span className="em">(27,26)</span>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              The pool of lava might look too crowded, but actually you can get
              solo pulls if you know the trick. Out of the 6 mobs at this lava
              pool, 3 of them are{' '}
              <span className="strong">Twilight Idolaters</span>, and they don't
              assist if you pull a mob that is next to them, they are busy
              performing a ritual. They will only attack if you attack them
              directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="em">
                So first you must pull the mobs one by one and then the

              . Once you go the lava pool cleared, you can go get the quest from

              <span className="strong">Zameal Lunthistle</span>. After taking
              his quest, talk to him again and go through his dialogue, then

            Now all that is left for you to do is kill{' '}

          When you got both these items, you can say goodbye to your group and

            <p>
              There is one elite Dark Iron Sentry on the tower, you don't need
              to kill it, just run past it (or stealth past it if you are
              rogue/druid). If you can iceroot / sheep / fear it, do so, but you
              don't have to. Just ignore it, quickly search for a small bowl on

              click it everytime the timer is ready, it will create an
              "Evergreen herb casing", open it and loot what's inside. It can be
              various herbs but sometimes it will be{' '}
              <span className="item">Morrowgrain</span>, and that's what you
              need. You need <span className="item">2 Ungoro Soil</span>{' '}
              everytime you want to use the pouch, but you should still have
              about 20 left even after turning the quests.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will need a total of 20 Morrowgrain, which you might not get
              if you are unlucky with the evergreen pouch, however you will
              probably get 10 Morrowgrain at least, and that's what you'll need
              in short term, the other 10 morrowgrains are not so urgent, and
              we'll go back to Un'goro if you run out of Un'goro soils anyway.
              However once you got 20 Morrowgrain you can stop using the
              evergreen pouch. I personally sold the seeds and the un'goro soil
              I had left after obtained my 20 morrowgrain, and also destroyed
              the evergreen pouch, because I like having bag space{' '}

            For those who aren't already level 53, I suggest you grind until you

            For those who don't do Sunken Temple, you will have to grind about
            80000-90000XP. That's approximately half a level. However there's
            plenty of good spots to grind at this level, and for good reasons:
            Harpies for your Darkmoon Epic Necklace or Deadwood Furlbogs for

              At this point if you can find people to group it will be much

              hard), on the other hand there's an escort quest which is almost
              impossible solo, at least for most classes. It also depends on how
              crowded the area is, if there's lots of people farming in the
              shadow hold already, it's doable solo.

          <li>
            Escort Arko'Narin to her equipment, then escort her out, things can
            get rough at times because she engages 2 or 3 lvl 55 mobs a the same
            time and is fragile until she has her equipment on. In the same room
            where her equipment is you'll find the{' '}

              Defeat it and then Arko'narin will leave and you'll get the quest

            <p>
              If you don't find anyone to group with, just don't do the escort

              You can pull Rakaiah solo, the 4 warlocks will be aggro on you but
              won't attack as long as you don't directly attack them. After you
              got rid of Rakaiah, you will still be locked in combat mode
              because of the 4 warlocks, to lose combat mode you just have to
              run back some distance away from them until they forget you.
              Basically they never attack you unless you directly attack them.
              However the warlock's imp pets will attack you and you should

              It wasn't an easy fight to solo, I basically used everything I had
              with the mage and rogue. I sheeped Shadow Lord Fel'dan and killed
              the two succubus fast. Same with rogue, I sapped the shadow lord

            Blazerunner is a lvl 56 Elite fire elemental and he hits for 400. So
            just save this quest for when you are level 60 and have time to
            spend on that quest, the rewards aren't that great, we did it for
            XP.<p></p>
            <p>
              Anyway here is how to defeat{' '}
              <span className="strong">Blazerunner</span>, the last boss of the
              long quest chain "Linken's Adventure". Go to the top of fire plume
              ridge, clear all the <span className="strong">elementals</span>{' '}
              around to make sure they don't add during the fight. Equip the{' '}
              <span className="item">Silver Totem of Aquementas</span> and put
              it on a hotkey. Click it to dispel{' '}
              <span className="strong">Blazerunner's aura</span> right at the
              start and everytime it reappears. Blazerunner is somewhat
              invincible when his aura is on, he keeps knockbacking people and
              every damage he takes is divided by 10.{' '}
              <span className="strong">
                So be sure to always keep that aura dispelled
              </span>
              . <br />
              Another thing, fight him inside his cave with your back facing the
              walls, so if he knockbacks you when the aura appears again you
              won't end up being tossed off the mountain or into adds.
              <br />
              He's a tough fight, I did it with a level 57 Priest, a level 55
              Paladin and me (lvl 57 rogue) and it wasn't easy. On the other
              hand I soloed it with my lvl 57 frost mage, thanks to kiting, it
              took time and several attempts though. So I recommend saving that
              quest for when you are level 60 and have time to spend on it,
              unless you got enough people to help you immediately. Anyway if
              you do manage to kill Blazerunner, you must also go loot the{' '}
              <span className="strong">Ornate Chest</span> in his cave. Then
              turn in the quest at Linken.

              solo, so ask for help (Hunters, Warlocks and frost mages will
              probably be able to solo them though). If you don't find help
              immediatly for it, proceed with the next steps of the guide while
              actively looking for people to help you with the dragons. When you

              will appear at their corpse named{' '}

              Make a semi circle around the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock,

              Before you leave this area go to the northeastern edge of it,

            </p>
            <p>
              Get full hp/mana, get next to one of them and click your{' '}
              <span className="item">Temporal Displacer</span> (looks like a

                1 to 3 lvl 57 worms will spawn and attack you
              </span>
              . When it's 3 it might be tough to handle solo, so always start
              those fights with full hp and if possible potions / long cooldown
              abilities up. Back off from the silos after you summon the worms,
              if you stay too close more worms will spawn sometimes, and that's
              probably more than you can handle solo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The worms only appear when the silo is sparkling blue. They take a
              while to sparkle again after you use the temporal displacer next
              to them. There's 3 more silos just a bit more to the east.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep doing that until you have{' '}

            <p>
              Loot the Andorhal Watch from it. Keep doing this until you have{' '}

            </p>
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the town hall (with a tower clock) which is in the middle of
            Andorhal, close to where Araj the Summoner is, you can sneak in the
            town hall without having to fight any of the bunch of mobs close to
            it.<p></p>
            <p>
              Inside the town hall you'll find several{' '}
              <span className="strong">"Musty Tome"</span> lying on the floor.
              When you click one, there is a chance you will find the{' '}
              <span className="item">Annals of Darrowshire</span>, but there is
              a higher chance that you will get a{' '}
              <span className="item">"Ruined Tome"</span> and 1 or 2 level 57
              mobs will attack you. They give no loot and no exp. Hoewever there
              is a trick to know which tome is the right one.{' '}
              <span className="strong">
                There is a slight graphical difference
              </span>
              . The pages of the fake tomes have two-tone colored pages,
              lightbrown and white, like this one:{' '}

                className="bb-image"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The good tome looks "newer", and it's pages only have one color
              tone, like this one:{' '}
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              You can easily see the difference if you zoom in 1st person view
              and put your mouse pointer over the books to highlight them. Loot
              the <span className="strong">Annals of Darrowshire.</span>

              you need help, this almost impossible to do solo unless you use a

              happens when you click the dirt mount,{' '}
              <span className="strong">Mercutio Filthgorger</span> and{' '}

              to the dirt mound, if you are close they of course jump you.
              <br />
              They all hit hard, especially Mercutio, and all have a lot of hit
              points for non elites. Here is what I suggest:
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as you click the dirt mount, run to the other side of the
              fence, you can jump over it if you walk up the mountain a bit. The
              4 dwarves will walk to the grave and stand there.
