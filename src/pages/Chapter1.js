      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        This guide starts at{' '}
        <em>
          <strong>level 30</strong>
        </em>
        . It is your task to reach that level on your own and it shouldn&apos;t
        be a problem, you can check the other leveling guides in our leveling
        guide forum for the earlier levels. The main reason why I don&apos;t
        want to start a guide at level 1 is because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> It&apos;s not so needed</li>
        <li>
          Depending on your race/class choice you will start from different
          areas so covering them all would be a mess.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This guide is optimized for <strong>FAST</strong> leveling with a
        minimum of grinding sessions. Quests are important, they give rewards
        and faction and are less boring than pure grinding, BUT sometimes some
        quests are really a time waste and we will be skipping those and
        replacing them by good grinding spots when it is necessary. Some people
        say that Grinding is always faster than questing, this is true in theory
        when you don&apos;t know which quests to take and which to avoid, and
        what is the best order to do them. With this guide, questing will be
        very efficient and much better than pure grinding. Follow each
        instruction carefully and you will see for yourself. The quests choices
        and order to do them are optimal so that you run as few as possible
        while doing the most possible and then turning several quests at the
        same time. This guide will be very useful for both veteran and novice
        players, and this is why sometimes I describe things in two fashion{' '}
        <strong>&quot;In short&quot;</strong> (for the veterans) and{' '}
        <strong>&quot;in details&quot;</strong> (for the novices). That way the
        veteran players can skip those &quot;in details&quot; paragraph if the
        &quot;in short&quot; one was enough information for them. So even the
        guide itself is optimized for the minimum reading possible, to save
        time! Let&apos;s get started immediately then!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything described in this guide can be done solo (besides when I say
        otherwise). You can of course follow this guide while duoing, grouping,
        it&apos;s not a problem, it works too.
      </p>
      <h5>Basic rules:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          While traveling, <strong>kill everything that is on your way</strong>{' '}
          and gives experience (Yellow mobs preferably).
        </li>
        <li>
          {' '}
          Spend your <strong>talent points</strong> so you do the most damage
          possible. (e.g: Priest should specialize in Shadow Talents, Warriors
          in Arms/Fury, Rogues Combat/Assassination, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Don&apos;t waste your time trying to find groups for questing
          </strong>
          , you can solo everything that is described in this guide. Only group
          with someone when it&apos;s not gonna be a waste of time (e.g: meeting
          the person at the other end of the map to show him the way to where
          your quest is)
        </li>
        <li>Try to always log out in an Inn when you take a break.</li>
        <li>
          If I don&apos;t mention a quest, it means I consider it a waste of
          time, so don&apos;t take it thinking I forgot a quest here and there,
          I didn&apos;t.&nbsp;
          <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
            ðŸ™‚
          </span>
          <br />
          Also don&apos;t abandon a quest unless I say you should.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes I will be making lists of quest you should have before
          starting with an area, that doesn&apos;t mean I will list the whole
          quest log, JUST the quests that interest us for the moment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr />
      <h5>Shopping List:</h5>
      <p>
        Every time you pass by an auction house, try to buy the following items:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1X <TtLink id="2868">Patterned Bronze Bracers</TtLink> ~50 Silver
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These might not always be up for sale, so start checking early.</p>

        Chapter 1 - [Level 30 - 41] Journey from Thousand Needles to Badlands
      </h5>
      <h6>Level 30</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {' '}
          <strong>In Short</strong>: Go to <strong>Theramore</strong> by boat,
          in <strong>Theramore</strong> learn the new flight path, go to the
          Inn, make it your home location, then go to Thousand Needles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In Details</strong>: From <strong>Ironforge</strong>, take a
          flight path to <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong>, if you don&apos;t
          have that flight path, you&apos;ll have to go to wetlands and then run
          to <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong>. In{' '}
          <strong>Menethil Harbor</strong> take the boat to{' '}
          <strong>Theramore</strong> (It is the boat that stops at the southern
          peer). When in <strong>Theramore</strong>, find the Gryphon Master and
          get the flight path. Then go to the Inn, talk to the innkeeper and
          make theramore your home location. After that, go through Dustwallow
          Marsh by following the road northwest and then south to the Barrens.
          When in the Barrens, go south to <strong>Thousand Needles</strong>, go
          down the great lift (don&apos;t attack the guard just run past him,
          take the elevator and keep going until he forgets you).
        </li>
      </ul>
      In <strong>Thousand Needles</strong>, go west until you reach the border
      of <strong>Feralas</strong>, and find the alliance outpost:{' '}
      <strong>Thalanaar</strong> (5,17). Get the new flight path from there.
      <p>
        Go southeast along the mountain, keep going until you hit Roguefeather
        Den (27,51). It&apos;s grinding time! Don&apos;t worry, there will be a
        lot of questing after that, but you are gonna kill these harpies until
        those two goals are achieved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you hit level 31+</li>
        <li>
          you obtain 25 <span className="item">Vibrant Plumes</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The harpies are lvl 28-30, drop cash and silk cloth. There are a lot of
        them and they respawn fast. (Make sure to kill the harpies that are down
        on the ground and those that are in the cave up on the hill) With the 25{' '}
        <span className="item">Vibrant Plumes</span> you can get 60 Tickets at
        the Darkmoon Faire, you can then trade 50 Tickets for a 14 Slot Bag,
        which is a big plus at this level (unless you are a twink). Sadly the
        Darkmoon Faire is not always available, check this{' '}

        </a>{' '}
        to know when the Darkmoon Faire will be available, and put your{' '}
        <span className="item">Vibrant Plumes</span> in bank until then. If you
        don&apos;t want the bag, you can either auction those plumes (they sell
        nicely) or save them up for your future epic necklace.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 31</h6>
      <p>
        Go east until you reach the Mirage Raceway in the Shimmering
        Flats(80,77). Get the following quests there:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[30] Hardened Shells</span>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can find everything needed to complete those quests all around the
        raceway, do long circles all around it and kill everything on the way.
        <br /> If you have troubles finding buzzards, there is a nice spot with
        10 of them at (87,66).
        <br /> Keep doing this until you complete all the quests, get 10{' '}
        <span className="item">Turtle Meat</span> and hit level 32. Grind on
        turtles in particular, they drop scales which sell nicely. Don&apos;t
        sell the <span className="item">Turtle Meat</span>, put them in bank or
        somewhere in your inventory.
      </p>
      <p>Turn in all the quests and get the follow up quests : </p>
      <ul>

          <span className="quest">[35] Martek the Exiled</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before we leave, go south and zone into Tanaris. Go to Gadgetzan and
        talk to the Gryphon master on the other side of the town to get the new
        flight path. Hearthstone to <strong>Theramore</strong>, sell junk and
        repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get out of <strong>Theramore</strong> and follow the road northwest and
        then south to the Barrens. In the Barrens go north then east to Ratchet.
        Talk to Gazlowe in Ratchet, get the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[37] Goblin Sponsorship</span>. Also talk to
        Wharfmaster Dizzywig on the docks and get the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[36] Parts for Kravel</span>
        <br /> Take the boat to <strong>Booty Bay</strong>.{' '}

      <p>
        In <strong>Booty Bay</strong> on the docks, talk to Wharfmaster Lozgil
        and get the follow up. Get all the quests you can in
        <strong>Booty Bay</strong>. Then go to the Inn in{' '}
        <strong>Booty Bay</strong> and make it your home location.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go train new skills in Stormwind by gryphon ride (for rogues,
        there&apos;s a trainer on the 1st floor of booty bay inn). Visit the
        Auction house, repair, sell, buy 4 stacks of food/drink (of course
        don&apos;t buy drinks if you aren&apos;t a class with mana).
      </p>
      <h6>Level 32</h6>
      <p>At level 32 the zone we will be aiming for is Stranglethorn Vale. </p>
      Quest Gathering:
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fly to <strong>Darkshire</strong> and run west/south to{' '}

        No need to take the Green Hills of Stranglethorn quests (the one with
        the chapters), it will just encumber your quest log for now. You will
        complete each chapter when you get the right pages. So while you hunt
        always look out for these:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100509001851im_/http://www.goblinworkshop.com/pics/icons/INV_Misc_Note_06.jpg"

      <p>Hunting</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100509001851im_/http://www.wow-pro.com/guidepics/stvroute1.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: Kill River Crocolisks which can be found all along the river in
        northern Stranglethorn Vale until you find 2{' '}
        <span className="item">Large Crocolisk Skins</span>. While you search
        for crocs you can also kill Young Tigers close to the river for Tiger
        Mastery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Then kill 10 Young Tigers (or as much as you still got left)
        <br /> Tigers can be found mostly south and around the Nesingwary camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Kill Young Panthers, they are mostly found on the other side of
        the river to the east. (41,10).{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Go further northeast to the Kurzen Camp (44,11) and kill 15
        Kurzen Jungle Fighters as well as Kurzen Medecine Men until you get 7{' '}
        <span className="item">Jungle Remedies</span> (might take a while). Also
        you&apos;ll need a <span className="item">Fern Extract</span> from one
        of the piles of crates scattered around the Kurzen Compound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5: Once all 4 quests are done go turn them in (besides Supply and
        Demand, which you will turn in later) at the Rebel Camp where you get
        the follow up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[38] Special Forces</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 6: And at the Nesingwary camp where you get the follow ups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[33] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[33] Panther Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Step 7: Go west until you reach a plateau (30,9). Up there you can find
        Panthers and Tigers. Kill 10 of each.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: Further southwest on the plateau you should find Stranglethorn
        Raptors, kill 10.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: Go south and down the plateau until you find the troll camp at
        Bal&apos;lal Ruins (29,20)
        <br /> It should take a while to get 15{' '}
        <span className="item">Bloodscalp Ears</span> but it is a nice grinding
        spot anyway. So grind at this spot until you hit level 33. If you
        don&apos;t have enough trolls there is another camp northeast at the
        Tkashi Ruins (33,15).
      </p>
      <h6>Level 33:</h6>
      <p>
        Step 10: From the troll camps, go west until you hit the shore, and move
        along the shore towards the north until you find Crystal Spine
        Basilisks. If you run short on Basilisks, there is more on the lower
        plateau to the east along the shore. If there aren&apos;t any basilisks
        just go kill some trolls until they respawn. Kill basilisks until you
        get 10 <span className="item">Singing Crystal Shards</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: After that, take a swim westwards until you hit the island at
        loc (21,22), you will have to go towards the middle of the island so the
        quest <span className="quest">[37] The Stone of the Tides</span> is
        completed, but be careful with the lvl 37ish elementals on the isle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 12: When you completed all 6 quests, go turn in the 3 mastery
        quests at camp nesingwary and get the follow ups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Raptor Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[38] Panther Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check if you completed any of the chapters of the Stranglethorn pages
        quests as well and turn them in if you did.
      </p>

        Make sure you repair and sell junk at the vendor before you go again.
        You will probably need a lot of space in your bags with the extra pages
        you will find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 13: Now you probably must be about halfway to level 34. It&apos;s
        time to go grind at Kurzen camp or on the Trolls, up to you. When you
        are 1 bubble away from lvl 34, warp to <strong>Booty Bay</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>. Turn in the following quests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[31] Supply and Demand</span> at Drizzlik in
          the &quot;Tan-your-hide-Leatherwork&quot; shop. It is situated on the
          top floor and not too far from the inn in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Singing Blue Shards</span> on the ground
          floor in bootay bay inn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Bloodscalp Ears</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Krazek&apos;s Cookery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[32] Investigate the Camp</span> on the 2nd
          floor of the booty bay inn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] The Stone of the Tides</span> on the top
          floor of <strong>Booty Bay</strong> inn to Baron Revilgaz.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This should make you level up.
      <p>Step 5: Get follow up quests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Some Assembly Required</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Water Elementals</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[41] Venture Company Mining</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: If some follow up quests aren&apos;t mentioned it is because they
        aren&apos;t worth the trouble. Just take the ones listed above.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 34:</h6>
      <p>
        Since you are lvl 34 now, go train if you wish to do so. Closest place
        to train is Stormwind by gryffon. (Unless you are a rogue, there&apos;s
        a rogue trainer on the 1st floor of <strong>Booty Bay</strong> inn).
      </p>
      <p>
        While you are on gryffon (or in <strong>Booty Bay</strong>), ask in
        general channel if anyone has any page you need, and trade your spare
        pages in exchange or just buy them, they go for 10-15 silver on average.
        You can also check the <strong>Booty Bay</strong> auction house for
        missing pages. I suggest you even buy them overpriced (Offer 20-30
        Silver for a page and you should get it quickly). The sooner you
        complete the page collection, the better for your bag space.{' '}
        <span role="img" aria-label="tongue">

        </span>{' '}
        Anyway, time to hunt again!
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100509001851im_/http://www.wow-pro.com/guidepics/stvroute2.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: When you are done, go back to the jungle, follow the road north
        until you hit loc (39,22). And go westwards (towards the area north of
        Grom&apos;Gol Camp). You should find plenty of Lashtail Raptors there.
        Kill them as much as needed for the quests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2 &amp; 3: When done with raptors, you should hit the river to the
        east and search along the banks for Snapjaw Crocolisks. At the same time
        you can start heading to the Venture co. Camp next to Lake Nazferiti and
        kill Geologists there (44,20), they drop the &quot;tumbled
        crystals&quot; you need for{' '}
        <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span>. You can find
        crocolisks on both sides of the river, all around Lake Nazferiti and all
        the way down to Mizjal Ruins. Keep killing Goblins and Crocolisks until
        you get both quests complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: When done with that, head northwest until you hit the area in
        between Bal&apos;al Ruins and Tkashi Ruins (33,15). There you wil find
        Elder Stranglethorn Tigers and kill 10 of them.
      </p>
      <p>Step 5: Once done, go to Nesingwary Camp and turn in </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[35] Tiger Mastery</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Raptor Mastery</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Get the two follow ups and complete any chapter to get rid of pages taking
      up bag space.
      <p>
        Step 6: Go northeast until you hit the Kurzen Camp, this time go
        straight for the cave there and kill Commandos and Headshrinkers.
        Careful the Commandos are stealthers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 7: When done with that go southwest to find Sin&apos;dall.
        Sin&apos;dall is on top of a hill at (31,17) right in the middle of
        Bal&apos;al and Tkashi ruins. It is definitely soloable at lvl 34, just
        make sure all your long cooldown abilities are up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: Once Sin&apos;dall is dead, head west until you hit the island
        you discovered before (21,22), and kill Water Elementals there until you
        get 6 <span className="item">Water Elemental Bracers</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: At this point you should be getting close to level 35. If you
        are not, grind on trolls until you are about 3 bubbles of XP away from
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 10: When that is done, go turn in your quests at the Nesingwary and
        Rebel camps, at the Rebel Camp get the folllow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[38] Kurzen&apos;s Mystery</span>. By now you
        should have completed your page collections or be close, if you
        aren&apos;t it&apos;s ok, we will be back in Stranglethorn Vale in about
        3 levels and then you ll for sure complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: Warp to <strong>Booty Bay</strong>, turn in the quests
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Hostile Takeover</span> at Kebok (inn).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[37] Water Elementals</span> at Baron Revilgaz
          on to of the Inn. Get follow up{' '}

        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="quest">[36] Some Assembly Required</span> at Drizzlik
          (Leather-and-hide shop),
        </li>
      </ul>
      Don&apos;t get the follow up. Go to the bank and get the 10{' '}
      <span className="item">Turtle Meat</span> you saved since Thousand
      Needles, and make space in your bags in case you still have Stranglethorn
      pages.
      <p>Time to travel!</p>
      <p>
        If you already know how to get there, go to Southshore in Hillsbrad
        Foothills (or take a Gryffon Ride)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don&apos;t know how to get there:
        <br /> Take a gryffon ride to Stormwind, then use the tram or gryffon to
        <strong>Ironforge</strong>, then gryffon ride to Southshore or Arathi.
        If you don&apos;t have those flight paths, fly to Wetlands. From
        Menethil in Wetlands follow the road east and then north until you zone
        into Arathi Highlands; keep going north until you reach Refuge Pointe
        (46,46). Get the flight path there. From Refuge Pointe take the road
        west until you reach Hillsbrad Foothills. In Hillsbrad Foothils follow
        the road west and then south at the 3rd fork. Southshore is at loc
        (50,55). Talk to the Gryphon Master in Southshore. and bind at the Inn.
        You should be level 35 or close by now.
      </p>
      <p>Gather all the quests in Southshore, you should have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        can complete immediately because you already got 10{' '}
        <span className="item">Turtle Meat</span>. You can buy the soothing
        spices from the trade goods merchant in the first house to the right
        when entering Southshore from the north.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don&apos;t bother with{' '}
        <span className="quest">[34] Bartolo&apos;s Yeti Fur Cloak</span> unless
        you are a Leatherworker or got a Leatherworker friend who can make a
        <span className="item">Hillman&apos;s Cloak</span>. You can buy a{' '}
        <span className="item">Bolt of Woolen Cloth</span> at the auction house
        or ask a tailor.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 35</h6>
      <p>Let&apos;s start with some Murloc slaughtering!</p>
      <p>
        Step 1: The murlocs are right next to the town on the western shore.
        Kill 10 Tidehunters and 10 Oracles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Go turn it in and get the follow up. Go back and kill more
        murlocs until you get 10 <span className="item">Murloc Heads</span>.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Go turn in the quest, get the follow up. Speak with Marshal
        Redpath in Southshore, get follow up and talk to Lieutenant Fahren
        again. Get the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[32] Stormwind Ho!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sell and repair (there&apos;s an armorsmith behind a small house next to
        the inn)
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Time to hunt Nagas now. The ones you need are on the eastern
        shore, right next to the town. Kill 10 Daggerspine Shorehunters and 10
        Daggerspine Sirens, go back to Southshore and talk to Lieutenant Farren
        again and get the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[32] Reassignment</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5: Now take a flight path to Refuge Pointe (Arathi Highlands). In
        Refuge Pointe get the quest{' '}
        <span className="quest">[36] Worth its Weigh in Gold</span> from
        Apprentice Kryten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 6: Go southeast until you reach the Go&apos;Shek Farm (60,53) and
        find the NPC named Quae, she is looking over the Go&apos;Shek Farm from
        the northwest edge. Talk to her and take the follow up quest{' '}
        <span className="quest">[36] Hints of a new Plague?</span>. You need to
        find and kill a Forsaken Courier and loot{' '}
        <span className="item">A Sealed Folder</span> from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short</strong>: The Forsaken Courier roams from the
        Go&apos;Shek Farm all along the road up until the wall to Hillsbrad
        Foothils. He is lvl 35 and doesn&apos;t have that much hit points, but
        he has 4 level 35 bodyguards. Find a way to kill and loot the Courrier.
        You can do it solo at level 35, I&apos;ve done it with 5 different
        classes and I&apos;ve heard about other players doing the same. For
        instructions on how to kill the courier with a certain class, see below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In Details</strong> Now you need to find and kill the Forsaken
        Courier, he roams from the Go&apos;Shek Farm all along the road up until
        the wall to Hillsbrad Foothils. He has 4 bodyguards, all level 35.{' '}
        <br />
        There are many ways to kill it though, even solo at level 35.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Warrior: for exemple, charge the courrier, hit Retaliate, use
          Intimidating Shout, kill the courier fast, loot it and then run away.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mage, burn him down as fast as possible, start from max range with
          Pyroblast if you got it, use ice root on the bodyguards, finish the
          courrier fast. Use a Health Potion if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rogue, you can single the courier out. Use Distract so that only one
          guard stops while the rest keeps walking, then kill the guard solo,
          rinse and repeat until you get the courier solo. You can also just
          rush in the pack, hit Evasion and kill the courier quickly before
          evasion runs out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warlock and Hunter: Send in the pet and burn the Courrier as fast as
          possible while your pet dies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Priest: Powerword:Shield and Renew yourself, be at max range, start
          with Smite, then a Mind Blast while the mobs run to you, then a Shadow
          Word:Pain. The bodyguards should be on you at this moment, use Psychic
          Scream, and keep on burning the Courrier with Mind Flay / Mind Blast.
        </li>
        <li>Paladin Just go for the courier and use your invulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There must be a way for each class to solo this at level 35, use
        creativity, potions, and long cooldown abilities. If you don&apos;t
        manage it, try to get a partner to duo it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 7: Once you got the <span className="item">Sealed Folder</span>{' '}
        from the Forsaken Courier, go back to Quae (60,53). Turn in and get the
        follow up <span className="quest">[37] Hints of a new Plague?</span>,
        where you have to escort Kinelory.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the escort, one word of advice: Let Kinelory be in the front, always
        walk behind her, when mobs aggro her, help her take them out one by one.
        And make sure they don&apos;t run far. Kinelory is quite a tank and can
        also heal a bit. If you let her be in front and don&apos;t let runners
        create trains, you will complete the quest easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8: When completed, talk to Quae and get the follow up. Then go
        southeast of Go&apos;Shek Farm to the troll village (63,65).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kill trolls until you get 10 <span className="item">Tusks</span>. Kill
        Witch Doctors until you get 4{' '}
        <span className="item">Medicine Pouches</span>. Further inside the
        village and to the south (68,75) you will find a cave. Inside the cave
        you will find Witherbark Shadow Hunters and get the{' '}
        <span className="item">Hunter Knife</span> you miss to complete the
        quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 9: Once completed, run back to Refuge Pointe in Arathi and turn in
        the troll quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearthstone to Southshore, and talk to Phin Odelic and complete the
        quest &quot;Hints of a New plague&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>Sell and repair.</p>
      <p>
        Step 10: Go north and follow the road north until you zone to Alterac
        Mountain (96,47). A bit further up and to the right you will find
        Soferan&apos;s Naze (58,67). Clear the Syndicate camp there, and in the
        middle of the camp on a table you should find parchments named
        &quot;Syndicate Documents&quot;. Right click one of them and get the two
        quests <span className="quest">[34] Encrypted Letter</span> and{' '}
        <span className="quest">[34] Foreboding Plans</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go northwest towards the snowy mountains where you will find
        Crushridge Ogres, they drop the{' '}
        <span className="item">Dirty Knucklebones</span> you need. <br /> When
        you run short on ogres, you can go to the southwest where you will find
        the area called &quot;Corrahn&apos;s Dagger&quot; (47,76). There you can
        kill Syndicate Footpads and Syndicate Thieves as well as Mountain Lions
        and Hulking Mountain Lions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest you go back and forth from this spot to the ogres whenever you
        run short on mobs. Do this until the Ogre and Syndicate quests are
        completed. Then there&apos;s more Lions further to the west at &quot;The
        Headland&quot; (38,55).
      </p>
      <p>
        You should keep going westwards while killing lions until you complete
        your quest. At this point you should be close to level 36, if not, grind
        on ogres / syndicates until you are about 2 bubbles away from level up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 11: Go northwest towards Dalaran until you reach Archmage Ansirem
        (18,78). Turn in the quest{' '}
        <span className="quest">[37] Magical Analysis</span> and get the follow
        up <span className="quest">[37] Ansirem&apos;s Key</span>. Then warp to
        Southshore or run there if Hearthstone isn&apos;t ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turn in the 5 quests in Southshore. Get the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[34] Letter to Stormpike</span> from Loremaster
        Dibbs. Don&apos;t get the other follow ups.
        <br /> Congratulations on level 36.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 36</h6>

      <p>Step 4: Take the boat to Ratchet. And then:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In short: Go to Desolace</li>
        <li>
          In detail: From Ratchet, follow the road to the west until you reach
          Stonetalon Mountains. In Stonetalon Mountains follow the road
          west/northwest until you are past Sunrock Retreat and reach Mirkfallon
          Lake, keep following the road until you can go west in between two
          cliffs. Follow this path, go south through the charred vale and you
          will arrive in Desolace.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When in Desolace, go to Nijel&apos;s Point . To access it you have to go
        further southwest until loc (67,16).

        We are not taking the quest{' '}

          Hatefury Satyrs in Sargeron, southeast of Nigel&apos;s Point (75,20).

          When you got 10 <span className="item">Hatefury Claws</span> and 10{' '}
          <span className="item">Hatefury Horns</span> go west to the area just
          north of Thunder Axe Fortress (56,17) you will find a ruined caravan
          there. Look for <span className="item">Malem Chest</span>. It&apos;s
          not actually a chest, rather a crate. Open it, get the follow up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go back to Nijel&apos;s Point and get the follow up. Turn in the Satyr
          quest as well but don&apos;t get the follow up (huge time waste). Sell
          and Repair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go southwest and past Thunder Axe Fortress. Then go west towards the
          sea until you see a big tower. Azore Aldamort is next to the tower
          just north of it down the cliff (38,27). Get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[33] The Sceptre of Light</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          From there, go southwest to the shore towards (36,30), you should see
          the mast of a sunken ship. The Ravnitol Chest is on the shore at
          (36,30). Open it, and get the follow up quest. Right next to the chest
          is a black book named &quot;Rackmore&apos;s Log&quot;. Click it and
          get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[36] Claim Rackmore&apos;s Treasure</span>.{' '}
          <span className="item">Rackmore&apos;s Silver Key</span> drops from

          <span className="item">Rackmore&apos;s Gold Key</span> drops from any
          Slitherblade Naga. Take a swim and kill Drysnaps around the ship until
          you get a Silver Key. It takes about 10 kills on average. Then further
          north go kill Siltherblade Nagas until you get a gold key. 10 kills on
          average as well to get a Golden Key.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have both keys, go east to the Thunder Axe Fortress. Enter
          the fortress through the main gate (56,30), go kill the Seer (he has
          one guard) on top of the 1st watch tower to the left past the gates.
          Loot the Sceptre of Light.
          <br />
          Then go in the big building and talk to Dalinda, get the follow up
          quest <span className="quest">[33] Search for Tyranis</span>. Tyranis
          is in the other building (the smaller of the two), southwest of the

          <br /> Go back to Dalinda. Before you talk to her, clear the whole
          building. After you talk to her she will start to walk out of the
          fortress, escort her and make sure she doesn&apos;t die. <br />
          Warning: Dalinda is one of those stupid escort NPCs who don&apos;t
          stop when YOU are attacked. So let her in the front and make sure she
          gets hits first. Once out of the fortress she will run away and you
          will get a &quot;Quest Complete&quot; message.

          Vultures if they are in the way. When you loot a bone there&apos;s a

          can run away or deal with it, up to you, they disappear after about 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you got 10 Kodo bones, run east to Scrabblescrew Camp (60, 61)

          When done with that, go southeast to the Magram Village (70,70) and
          kill centaurs until you are friendly with the Gelkis (exactly 50
          Kills, 46 if you are human). You can check your reputation with the

      <p>
        At this point you should be level 37 already. If not, you should keep on

      <p>
        This session started with the Satyr quest and finished right now after
        turning in all the quests in Nijel&apos;s Point. That was done with a
        level 36 character with average gear, solo, on a new server (no twink).
        I&apos;ve tried it with 3 different classes and it works just as well.
        And there is still two quests to turn in, that&apos;s just to show how
        efficient the quest path of desolace can be when done the right way.{' '}
        <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
          ðŸ™‚
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Warp to <strong>Ironforge</strong>, go to the Hall of Explorers and turn
        in the quest <span className="quest">[39] The Karnitol Shipwreck</span>.
        <br />
        <br />
        At this point, you got 2 options:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go to Scarlet Monastery. I highly recommend this, an instance run will
          slow down your exp rate (unless you get a good group going fast). But
          every 10 level or so you need some gear upgrades and instances are the
          best for that, Scarlet Monastery is a great instance, not too time
          consuming. And you already got the main quest. Go further in the Hall
          of Explorers and get{' '}
          <span className="quest">[38] Mythology of the Titans</span> from
          Librarian Mae Paledust. Repair, sell, check auction house etc. Then
          fly to Southshore, turn in the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[39] Down the Scarlet Path</span> and get the
          follow up <span className="quest">[40] In the Name of the Light</span>
          . Get a group together and go to Scarlet Monastery in Tirisfal Glade,
          follow our{' '}

          </a>{' '}
          and you should be fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          You don&apos;t like instances at all. In that case, go to the next
          step of the guide, Badlands.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note: Doing Scarlet monastery got me about 75000 XP. That&apos;s almost
        a full level, so I was level 38 and halfway to level 39 before going to
        Badlands.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 38:</h6>
      <p>Badlands:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You should be in <strong>Ironforge</strong>, if not, use Hearthstone,
          as you should still be bound there. Get the{' '}
          <span className="item">Patterned Bronze Bracers</span>, the{' '}
          <span className="item">Frost Oil</span> and the{' '}
          <span className="item">Gyrocronatom</span> from your bank (or buy them
          now if you didn&apos;t yet). I suggest you buy 4 stacks of food/drink
          at least before leaving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the Hall of Explorers and get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Ironband wants you!</span> from
          Prospector Stormpike.
        </li>
        <li>
          From <strong>Ironforge</strong>, fly to Thelsamar, if you don&apos;t
          have the flight path, run out of <strong>Ironforge</strong>, follow
          the road east and take the tunnel at the South Gate Outpost (86,51)
          You will be in Loch Modan then, follow the road northeast to
          Thelsamar.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Thelsamar get the quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[39] Badlands Reagent Run</span> from Ghak

          Ironband&apos;s Excavation Site (65,65). Get the follow up quest from
          Prospector Ironband <span className="quest">[38] Find Agmond</span>.
          Then go southwest to Badlands.

      <p>In Badlands kill any Buzzard or Coyote you find on your way.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go south, past Hammertoe&apos;s Dig Site, until you find Prospector
          Ryedol and Sigrun Ironhew (53,43). Get quests:
          <br />
          <span className="quest">[35] A Dwarf and His Tools</span>
          <br />
          <span className="quest">[38] Mirages</span>

        <li>
          Go southwest and find Martek the Exiled (42,52) Turn in the quest and
          get follow up:

          <span className="quest">[39] Indurium</span>
          <br /> also get quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[40] Barbecued Buzzard Wings</span> from
          Rigglefuzz.
          <br />
          Note: Whenever you need to sell or repair, go to this spot. There is a
          goblin smithing supplier and it&apos;s the only vendor and repairer in
          Badlands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then go west and a bit to the north until you find Lotwil
          Veriatus&apos;s Camp (25,44). Get quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Study of the Elements: Rock</span>
          <p>
            Get <span className="quest">[37] Coolant Heads Prevail</span>, turn
            it in, get the Follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">[37]Gyro...What?</span> and turn in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Just west of Lotwil Veriatus you will find a lot of Lesser Elementals.
          This is a very nice grinding spot, they are easy to kill and drop
          stones which you can stack up and sell to merchants for nice cash.
          (However, you should try to AH Solid stones, deeprock salt and
          Elemental Earth, they sell fairly nice at the Auction house). Stay at
          this spot until you get 10{' '}
          <span className="item">Small Stone Shard</span> and hit level 39. If
          you don&apos;t like elementals, or if the spot is already overcrowded,
          go east to Angor Fortress, and kill Dwarves. For those who didn&apos;t
          go to Scarlet Monastery this will mean a long grinding session, but
          this will also mean good XP rate and cash (and you need to get your
          mount soon!). Go turn in{' '}
          <span className="quest">[37] Study of the Elements: Rock</span> at
          Lotwil Veriatus and get the follow up.

        <li>
          Then go northeast to Camp Kosh where you can find the{' '}

          Kill 12 Stonevault Bonesnapper and Murdaloc, you can find him inside
          the camp next to the Dwarven Corpse. Keep killing those Troggs until
          you get 10 <span className="item">Indurium Flakes</span> as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once both quests complete go south into the mountains and kill Rock
          Elementals at (40,73) until you get 3{' '}
          <span className="item">Large Stone Slab</span>s.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go west to the ogre area named Camp Cagg (10,72), kill ogres there
          until you get 7 <span className="item">Scrap Metal</span>. This may
          take a while.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go north to Apocryphan&apos;s Rest (16,60) and kill Buzzards / Coyotes
          until complete{' '}

          <span className="quest">[39] Badlands Reagent Run</span>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When that is done, go east to Martek the Exiled (42,52) and turn in the
        quests <span className="quest">[39] Indurium</span> and get the follow
        up <span className="quest">[38] News for Fizzle</span>. Turn in{' '}
        <span className="quest">[40] Barbecued Buzzard Wings</span> to
        Rigglefuzz as well. Repair and sell while you are here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then go northeast and turn in{' '}
        <span className="quest">[40] Scrounging</span> at Sirun Ironhew.
        <br /> After that go west to Lotwil Veriatus and turn in the quest, get
        the follow up{' '}
        <span className="quest">[42] Study of the Elements: Rock</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be getting close to level 40 at this point, about 35000 xp to
        go normally, if you still follow the &quot;kill everything on your
        way&quot; rule. Go grind on Rock Elementals or Lesser Rock Elementals,
        Dark Dwarves or Troggs. There are a lot of Dwarves at the Angor
        Fortress. It&apos;s up to you. Should take about 1h30 of grinding.
      </p>

        It went quite well for me, I was doing 41000 XP/Hour before I got to the
        grinding part. This is my XP rate starting from the moment I talked to
        Propector Ryedoll until level 40.

        So that&apos;s approximately 1 level and a half in 4 Hours. If you can
        do better, I would love to know!{' '}

      <h6>Level 40</h6>

        <li>
          At level 40 warp to <strong>Ironforge</strong>, train skills, repair,
          auction house, etc. Go get your mount if you can afford it (if not,
          you should soon, cause there is more elemental killing and grinding to
          do{' '}
          <span role="img" aria-label="tongue">

          </span>
          )
        </li>
        <li>
          When ready to go, fly to Thelsamar, turn in{' '}
          <span className="quest">[39] Badlands Reagent Run</span>. Go to
          Prospector Ironband and turn in{' '}
          <span className="quest">[42] Murdaloc</span>. Then go back to the
          Badlands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the southwestern part of the map (17, 83) and kill Greater Rock
          Elementals until you get 5{' '}
          <span className="item">Bracers of Rock Binding</span>. There&apos;s
          another camp of Greater Rock Elementals further to the west past the
          Ogres (6,83). This will be hard because some of the elementals are
          level 44. Try to find level 42 or 43 ones if the level 44 are too hard
          for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you are done, grind until you are about 5000 xp or less from
          level 41. Grind on Elementals, or Dwarves, up to you. Warning: This is
          a long grinding session, if grinding is too boring for you, then by
          all means do something else, go to Scarlet Monastery a few times for
          exemple. Also one of the reasons for grinding here even though we got
          a few quests we could do in Stranglethorn Vale is that I want to save
          these quests for later so we can do the whole rest of Booty Bay quests
          in one run. So right now we are already setting up a very juicy XP
          session for the future.{' '}

          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are 5000 xp away from level 41, go to Lotwil Veriatus, turn
          in <span className="quest">[42] Study of the Elements: Rock</span> and
          get the follow up{' '}
          <span className="quest">[42] This is Going to Be Hard</span>. Then go
          talk to his assistant Lucien Tosselwrench. Get quest{' '}
          <span className="quest">[42] Stone is Better than Cloth</span> and
          complete it, as you should still have the patterned bracers. This will
          make you ding level 41.

        This grinding sessions was tested by 3 different characters, the XP/Hour
        rate was in between 22000 XP/HOUR and 26000 XP/HOUR depending of the
        class. And there is still a nice little XP boost to come when completing
        the following steps. So grinding isn&apos;t bad at all, of course
        it&apos;s not as good as an optimized quest circuit, but it&apos;s still
        decent and you will see for yourself, it will bring a nice sum of cash.
        The stones from the elementals stack and sell nicely at the merchant,
        plus, they drop Elemental Earth which goes for at least 50 silver each
        at the AH. Same thing with the Dwarves, they drop Silk and sometimes
        Mageweave. Sell Silk / Mageweave at the AH and you&apos;ll get
        &apos;rich&apos; quickly.
      </p>
      <h6>Level 41</h6>
      <p>
        Complete <span className="quest">[42] This is Going to be Hard</span>{' '}
        and get the follow up. Talk to Lotwil and complete the quest but BEFORE
        you accept the next step from Lotwil, be warned: A level 45 Elemental
        will spawn and you will have to defeat it. At level 41 this is hard but
        possible for every class. Just use every long cooldown ability you have
        as well as potions. Loot &quot;Lotwil&apos;s Shackles of Elemental
        Binding&quot; from the Fam&apos;retor Elemental and go turn in the quest
        to Lotwil. Congratulations, you are done with Badlands and with the
        first Chapter of this leveling guide! Warp to <strong>Ironforge</strong>{' '}
        and sell / repair / auction etc.
