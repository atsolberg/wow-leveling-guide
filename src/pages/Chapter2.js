            Run out of Booty Bay and take the first way left until the Bloodsail
            Encampment by the shore. <strong>Pretty Boy Duncan</strong> should
            be there <em>(28,69)</em>. if not, keep clearing the camp until he
            appears. Kill Pretty Boy Duncan and loot{' '}

            Get out of Booty Bay and go east towards the shore named{' '}
            <em>Wild Shore</em>. From there, go southwards while killing any{' '}
            <strong>Bloodsails</strong> on the way until you reach the 1st camp{' '}
            <em>(29,80)</em>.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear the camp and look for a map thingy named{' '}
            <span className="item">&quot;Bloodsail Charts&quot;</span> or{' '}
            <span className="item">&quot;Bloodsail Orders&quot;</span>, If you
            don&apos;t find either, move on further south until you find a small
            boat ashore, check it for maps as well.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Careful, the Bloodsail Warlocks really hurt, make sure you interrupt
            their shadowbolts if you can, and kill them fast then deal with
            their pets. If you are Rogue or Mage though, I suggest sap /
            polymorph on the warlock first, kill the pet and then the warlock.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Now go further south until you find a bigger camp <em>(27,82)</em>.
            This camp will be harder to clear, but it&apos;s possible if you do
            it carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check the camp for Bloodsail Orders or Charts. Basically, the
            Bloodsail Charts and Orders can spawn at any of the two camps or at
            the boat. So check all three until you got both. Then wander up and
            down the shore where you came from and kill{' '}
            <strong>Bloodsails</strong> until you get:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {' '}

              <li>
                {' '}
                <span className="item">1 Dizzy&apos;s Eye</span> (can drop from

              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            When that is done, get back on the main road and go north until you
            reach <em>(39,41)</em>, slightly long ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              ** From this point on, if you find any{' '}

            At <em>(39,41)</em> go east and you will find{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Then go west to the other side of the road, you should find{' '}
            <strong>Jungle Stalkers</strong> <em>(34,37)</em>. Kill 10.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go northeast to <em>(36,35)</em> and kill{' '}
            <strong>Shadowmaw Panthers</strong> until you got 10 kills. You can
            find them in the area all around that big hill next to the tribal
            leatherworking troll NPC. They can be a bit hard to find sometimes
            because they are stealthers so I suggest you hit &quot;Tab&quot; key
            while running around and open your eyes well{' '}
            <em>(humans use your racial ability perception)</em>.{' '}

          <p>
            Keep doing circles around that big hill and you will find 10
            panthers quickly. Kill anything on the way too while searching those
            panthers.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Go east to <strong>Ziata&apos;Jai Ruins</strong> <em>(42,36)</em>{' '}
            and clear the camp of trolls. Be careful to avoid the patrols.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            When it&apos;s cleared, follow the little path northeast until you
            reach <strong>Balia&apos;mah Ruins</strong> <em>(45,33)</em>. Kill
            all the trolls there as well. When this camp is clear, follow the
            path southeast and then south until you reach the ruins of{' '}
            <strong>Zul&apos;Mamwe</strong> <em>(47,38 )</em> and kill all the
            trolls you find in the ruins (Though avoid the southernmost one up
            the plateau, the trolls there are higher level)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you run out of trolls go back to the first ruins of{' '}
            <strong>Ziata&apos;Jai</strong> and repeat this cycle until you get{' '}

      <h6>Level 42</h6>

              <strong>level 42</strong>
            </em>{' '}
            and got all your tusks, get back on the main road and go north until
            you get to the <strong>Venture Co. Base</strong> at Lake Nezferiti,
            go to the Operations Center which looks like an oil rig platform{' '}
            <em>(42,18 )</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go on top of it and kill <strong>Foreman Cozzle</strong>, loot his{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Now go west across the lake and keep going west until the{' '}
            <strong>Bal&apos;lal Ruins</strong> <em>(29,20)</em>, clear the camp
            and click the big tablet named{' '}

            <span className="item">scroll</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go directly west from the Bal&apos;lal Ruins and into the sea,

            the outer wall of the underwater ruins. <br />
            You don&apos;t need to kill any of the murlocs there, the tablet can
            be accessed safely. Loot the 2nd scroll.

          <p>
            Then go north to the Zuuldaia Ruins and take the western entrance{' '}

          You really don&apos;t like Uldaman, then go to the next part of my
          guide, but that will mean more grinding for you. I strongly advice you
          to go to Uldaman though, you already have most of the pre-questing
          done, just need to gather a few missing quests quickly. And trust me,
          there will be big exp bonuses later on thanks to going to Uldaman.

              click it and keep the quest. You&apos;ll find beacons in Feralas
              and Hinterlands as well, proceed equally with those. Each of those
              beacons start a quest where you will have to find a Homing Robot
              and escort it. The beacons won&apos;t always drop for you, they
              are kinda rare. The escort quests are hard to do solo especially
              for certain classes. But if you are lucky to find all 3 beacons
              you should really put the effort and finish all 3 rescue quests,
              it will be described when to do them in the guide later on.
              Anyway, if you don&apos;t get a distress beacon, or if you
              don&apos;t manage to complete the rescue quests, it&apos;s not a

                <strong>1st Warning:</strong> The Chicken robot is stupid and
                doesn&apos;t assist you all the time if you get attacked. Let
                him in the front so he gets the first hit. He has a decent
                amount of HPs and heals back to full after each fight is over.
                You can even eat/drink a bit after a fight and let the chicken
                walk in the front (not too far away though). Don&apos;t even
                think about looting, you don&apos;t have time. Don&apos;t let
                the chicken tank more than one at a time, and don&apos;t let him
                tank too long either.

                <strong>2nd Warning</strong>: When out of the Yeti cave, the
                chicken will take a left turn and go towards the road, at some
                point 3 yetis will ambush him. Don&apos;t panic, you can let one
                of the yetis be tanked by the chicken at the beginning and deal
                with the other 2. Just check the chicken&apos;s health
                regularly. There will be a 2nd and a 3rd ambush, be prepared for
                them. Especially the last one is composed of 4 Gnolls.

          <p>
            <strong>Andre Firebeard</strong> spawns at the campfire right in the
            center of the camp. He has 3 Dock Workers close to him but you can
            pull those 3 without him if you pull the back one, then you have
            Andre solo. Or you can burn him down fast and run away (or take them
            all).
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, this place is usually crowded because it is a good grinding

            have to use the &quot;Kill one and run away&quot; tactic to get to

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This quest, unlike the Feralas one, is more likely to be done
              solo. It&apos;s still not a walk in the part of course. So if you
              got a partner to duo it, all the better for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the chicken run in front of you, let it get the first hit. If
              it&apos;s not getting hit, it won&apos;t fight back. Sometimes
              mobs are actually chasing the chicken and failing to get a hit on
              it, so they give up.
            </li>
            <li>
              You&apos;ll have to face 2 ambushes of 3 mobs each, make sure you
              are full health/mana and with long cooldown abilities up when you
              start the escort. When the 3 ambushers attack, stand back until
              the chicken gets hit. Then let the chicken tank one of the 3 adds,
              deal with the 2 others as quick as you can, then help the chicken
              finish off the 3rd add.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you don&apos;t have the beacon, you can come back later when you
            get one. But of course now is the most efficient time to do it,
            cause it&apos;s on your quest path{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            She is easy to discern from the rest because she&apos;s the only
            aggressive turtle (red name -- turn NPC names on in your interface
            options, advanced options tab). She roams a lot, so you&apos;ll find

          <p>
            You and two level 50s should be just enough to kill the 2 NPCs on
            top of the Altar of Zul. More will make it easier of course. I even
            managed to do it with just me (lvl 47 rogue) and a level 48 priest.

            You can take the 2 follow ups (which appear lvl 55 but are still
            about the same mobs) if you feel like it and redo the quests several
            times, it&apos;s not so bad for grinding as you get an extra 550XP,
            21 Silver and faction increase with all Steamwheedle Cartel factions
            per quest turn in, but on the other hand those elementals are kinda
            hard to kill with certain classes, so I&apos;ll let you be the judge
            here. (I redid both quests only once, then it was getting too boring{' '}

          <p>
            First <strong>go west</strong> to <em>(38,15)</em>, next to a thick
            square tower you&apos;ll find a dark gazebo, inside of it is the

            <span className="item">Byltan Essence</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go <strong>northeast</strong> to <em>(40,12)</em> to some big ruined
            arch, the 2nd flame is on the top of it in the middle. To get there
            you have to get behind the building and jump from stones to stones
            until you can reach the flame of Samha. Right click it and loot the{' '}
            <span className="item">Samha Essence</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go back and jump down the building, directly northeast of it
            and on slightly higher ground among ruins you will find the flame of
            Imbel. <em>(39,9)</em> Loot the{' '}
            <span className="item">Imbel Essence</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go southwest (ignore Shay Leafrunner for now if you see her)
            until <span className="item">(37,11)</span>. The Flame of Lahassa is
            under a dark brown gazebo. Loot the{' '}

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now that you have all 4 essences, go <strong>southeast</strong> to
            the Equinex Monolith <em>(38,13)</em>. Clear some space around it,
            then go to it, search your bags for{' '}
            <span className="item">Troyas&apos;s Stave</span>. Right click it to
            charge the stave, then right click the monolith, complete the quest,
            get the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[50] The Morrow Stone</strong>
            </span>
            .
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Get out of the Monolith area and then clear yourself a path{' '}
            <strong>northwest</strong> to Shay Leafrunner. Before you take the
            quest, <em>here is the trick :</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            After taking the quest you must loot the bell from the chest next to
            Shay. Make a hotkey of that bell. Now here is the problem with Shay,
            she wanders off every now and then, she always says something like
            &quot;oh what a beautiful flower&quot; and goes away. When she does
            that you are supposed to ring the bell and she will run back to you.
            The problem is that the bell has a rather long cooldown so she ends
            up wandering off too often.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick is that{' '}
            <strong>
              as soon as you ring the bell, she will run to you, so you should
              start running southeast / south towards Rockbiter
            </strong>{' '}
            <em>(42,21)</em> and she will keep running after you until she
            catches up.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she catches up she will say something like &quot;I wandered off
            again, sorry&quot;. But the cooldown on the bell will be reset
            already.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>In short:</em>
            </strong>{' '}
            When she wanders off, ring the bell and run away, don&apos;t let her
            catch up to you. Even if you get aggroed by mobs keep running. Only
            stop if Shay herself gets attacked, then you will have to defend
            her. You can run and look behind you by holding your mouse&apos;s
            left click and moving the mouse, to make sure she&apos;s still
            running after you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once at the giant, turn in the quest. Then go southeast and back on
            the road, follow the road south and then east until <em>(54,41)</em>
            .
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now you can go south back into the Yeti Cave and try to escort the
            Homing Robot again if you didn&apos;t before. It&apos;s still really
            hard solo, but at level 47 I managed to do it (was extremely close
            with the mage though).
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend finding someone willing to duo it with you. Anyway, one
            advice, just <strong>ALWAYS</strong> let the chicken get hit first
            before you do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don&apos;t manage to solo this quest or can&apos;t find a
            person to duo it just abandon it. It&apos;s really optional, but do
            try hard though.{' '}

            Get full health/mana, refresh buffs. Check if your long cooldown
            abilities are up. For some classes this will be hard to solo, so if
            you don&apos;t manage it better find someone to duo it with. If you

            <em>Things to know about this escort quest:</em>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Let the chicken in front, let him get hit first. Sometimes mobs
                will aggro him but not manage to hit him while he walks and they
                will just give up.
              </li>
              <li>
                The first part of the escort is the hardest as you will run into
                lvl 46-47 mobs. And at some point you will get an ambush of 3
                level 46 scorpions. Use your long cooldown abilities there.
                After this, it gets easier.
              </li>
              <li>
                Later on you will get a 2nd ambush, 3 humanoids lvl 42 (green).
                One will be a shadow mage though, kill it first.

            <span className="quest">[50] An OOX of your own</span>. You&apos;ll
            get another of those useless pets and{' '}
            <strong>7100 XP as well</strong>! Which is why going through the
            pain of doing those 3 escort quests is in the end worth it. (Sadly
            the Tanaris beacon never dropped for the character I used to record
            the XP Rates, so I didn&apos;t get this bonus)

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go back to <strong>Ironforge</strong>. Now here is what I advise:
            Get a group together and go to <strong>Zul&apos;Farrak</strong>.
            Follow this{' '}
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101208214225/http://www.wow-pro.com/node/588">
              Zul&apos;Farrak Instance Guide
            </a>
            . It would be a waste not to go, you already have all the pre-quest
            work done, you just have to gather a few more quests in Tanaris (and
            one in Dustwallow Marsh).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you don&apos;t like instances, I really suggest you do an
            effort on this one, it will be a great XP boost and you also get
            follow up quests which will be another source of extra XP later.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              You don&apos;t even have to do everything in Zul&apos;Farrak. You
              can skip Antu&apos;Sul and Witch Doctor Zum&apos;Rah, which are
              arguably the hardest battles in there.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also skip Gahz Ridian actually, but if you get someone in
            your group with the Mallet, you might as well go for it. Just make
            sure you do at least:
            <ul>
              <li> Kill Theka the Martyr (Get 1st Tablet)</li>
              <li> The Temple script (Loot Nekrum&apos;s Medaillon)</li>
              <li> Kill Hydromanther Velratha (Loot 2nd Tablet)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me just 2 Hours with a crapy pick-up group for a huge XP
            boost.{' '}
            <em>If you really don&apos;t want to go to Zul&apos;Farrak:</em>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can abandon the quests related to it and go grind up to level
            49. (Because those who go to Zul&apos;Farrak will ding 49 from
            turning in the quests even if they don&apos;t do all the quests,
            Gazh&apos;Rilla and Troll Temper namely)
          </p>
          <p>
            You can grind either in Feralas on <strong>Yetis</strong> or on{' '}
            <strong>Harpies</strong> (good for Darkmoon Faire Tickets). You can
            also grind on <strong>ogres</strong> in Tanaris if you prefer.

        </li>
        <li>

            <strong>
              <em>For those who go to Zul&apos;Farrak</em>
            </strong>
            , the optimal setup would be that one person of your group has{' '}
            <strong>the Mallet</strong> to summon{' '}
            <strong>Gahz&apos;Rilla</strong>. If you can&apos;t manage that
            it&apos;s np, this is optional and you can always come back later
            when you have your own mallet, if you wish to.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases, when you stop by Tanaris, talk to Sprinkle and get
            the follow up <span className="quest">[49] Delivery for Marin</span>
            .
          </p>

            <span className="quest">[49] Noggenfogger Elixir</span> and turn it
            in. The elixirs are more fun than useful but sometimes they give
            nifty effects like levitation or water breathing, which can be
            helpful situationaly. Plus now you can buy Elixirs from Marin at

            Those who did Zul&apos;Farrak should have already 4 bubbles in level

            Start killing directly from here, you can find all the animals you
            need to kill for theses quests in the upper part of Blasted Lands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid the area around the Dark Portal and the Tainted Scar. Avoid
            anything that is level 52 or above. Kill pretty much everything on
            your way until you have all the quests completed.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Beware</strong> of the big drake flying around named{' '}

            What you&apos;ll need to kill the most though are{' '}
            <strong>vultures and basilisks</strong>, so here is a path you
            should follow, listing every possible Vulture spawn (there&apos;s
            also a few vulture roamers but you&apos;ll run into those too from
            time to time) so try to get all of them every cycle.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            Completing all the quests will take a while, but here are a few
            tips:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Melees:</strong> As soon as possible try to finish the
                quest{' '}
                <span className="quest">
                  <strong>[50] The Decisive Striker</strong>
                </span>{' '}
                and go turn it in, you&apos;ll get a +25 AGI buff for 1 Hour.
                When that buff wears out, go turn in either{' '}
                <strong>Snickerfang Jowls</strong> (+25 STR buff) or{' '}
                <strong>A Boar&apos;s Vitality</strong> (+25 STA buff) depending
                on your preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Casters:</strong> As soon as possible try to finish the
                quest{' '}
                <span className="quest">
                  <strong>[50] A Boar&apos;s Vitality</strong>
                </span>{' '}
                and turn it in for a +25 STA buff. Later on after your sta buff
                wears off, try to finish{' '}
                <span className="quest">
                  <strong>[50] The Basilisk&apos;s Bite</strong>
                </span>{' '}
                for a +25 INT buff.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These buffs will help you killing faster, they do not stack, so wait
            for them to fade before you get the next one. Make good use of them{' '}
            <span role="img" aria-label="smile">
              🙂
            </span>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            While killing mobs in Blasted Lands you might loot an{' '}
            <span className="item">Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment</span> on one
            of them. Go to Kum&apos;Isha the Collector <em>(51,35)</em>. Get the
            quest{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              [55] Everything Counts in Large Amounts
            </span>{' '}
            and turn it in. No need to get the follow up quest unless you get
            another Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment. If you are extremely lucky
            you&apos;ll find a{' '}
            <span className="item">Flawless Draenetyst Sphere</span> In that
            case get the other quest from Kum&apos;Isha and turn it in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Turn in all the other blasted lands quest when they are done,
            don&apos;t get the follow ups (they are repeatable if you want to
            get more of those nifty clickable buffs later on). Now you should be
            approximately 4 bubbles away from level 50 if you did this right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hearthstone to <strong>Ironforge</strong> (or to Hinterlands if you
            are still bound there).
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to Aerie Peak in Hinterlands, talk to Gryphon Master Talonaxe.
            (he&apos;s at the very top of Aerie Peak) Get the follow up{' '}
            <span className="quest">
              <strong>[53] Saving Sharpbeak (Elite)</strong>
            </span>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you got <strong>3 reasons</strong> to go to the top of{' '}
            <strong>Jintha&apos;Alor</strong>. The Mallet of Zul&apos;Farrak
            being one of them, but most importantly:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="quest">
                  <strong>[50] The Ancient Egg (Elite)</strong>

                and
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="quest">
                  <strong>[53] Saving Sharpbeak (Elite)</strong>

            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Build a group</strong> of level 50+ and go to{' '}
            <strong>Jintha&apos;Alor</strong> <em>(66,66)</em>. It&apos;s doable
            with 3 level 50s but it will be long and very tedious at the end, I
            suggest you try to fill up the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fight your way to the top of Jintha&apos;Alor, then go to{' '}
            <strong>Vile Priestess Hexx</strong> <em>(59,78)</em>. She has one
            guard, you can wait till the Priestess wanders in the cave and get
            her guard solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then get the Priestess solo, kill her and loot the{' '}
            <span className="item">Hexx&apos;s key</span> from her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also don&apos;t forget to forge the{' '}
            <strong>Mallet of Zul&apos;Farrak</strong>, just click your Sacred
            Mallet while being next to the Altar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go inside the cave behind where you fought the Vile Priestess.
            Follow this path to find the Ancient Egg:

          </p>
          <p>
            You&apos;ll find Hitah&apos;ya the Keeper and 2 guards patrolling
            around the <span className="item">Ancient Egg</span>. Kill
            Hitah&apos;ya the Keeper first, should be a pushover for a group of
            4 or 5.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get the Ancient Egg. Once you have the Ancient Egg, clear the way
            out of the cave back to the Altar, from there go north towards the
            other cave at <em>(56,68)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kill the two trolls guarding it&apos;s entrance. Then go through the
            cave and on the other side of it you&apos;ll find{' '}
            <strong>Sharpbeak</strong> in it&apos;s cage. Free Sharpbeak and
            watch him fly away with his parents.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            You are done, hearthstone back to Aerie Peak and turn in the quest{' '}

          <p>
            Also turn in any stacks of 5 Troll Tribal Necklaces you might have

            </em>{' '}
            or be very close, and you can go kill some trolls next to the Altar
            of Zul to finish your level, or some ogres in Tanaris. For those who
