Perhaps it is time to initiate you into the Shera Ali'kh - Zandalari for Death's Hand. For thousands of years we have played the role of assassin for the Zandalar Empire. For too long we have sat idly, allowing the Hakkari to grow in strength. Once more we face Hakkar, but this time without the support of a united troll front. It is you and your allies who must assist in vanquishing the Blood God and his minions!<br /><br />Wear this talisman and let it assist you in your journeys.</td></tr></table>"}
