{"name":"A Fair Trade","tooltip":"<table><tr><td><b class=\"q\">A Fair Trade</b></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><br />Greetings, &lt;race&gt;. I am Kolark, Bounty &lt;class&gt; from Thunderbluff. Much of the world I have traveled and much I have seen.<br /><br />My journeys across the South Seas led to the discovery of these wonderous thorium headed arrows. Alas, I have an endless supply of the arrows but have exhausted my supply of shells. Bah, no self respecting Tauren would ever be caught dead using a flimsy bow. The arrows are useless!<br /><br />I will offer a trade: An even exchange of thorium shells for my thorium headed arrows. Deal?<br /><br /><span class=\"q\">Requirements:</span><br /> - Thorium Shells x 200</td></tr></table>"}
